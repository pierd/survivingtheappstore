# How to Read This Book

## If You're Only Going to Read One Thing in This Book, Read This ##

A successful iOS game makes $4,000 annually (this goes for any app
frankly). A successful Android game makes _one seventh_ of that (one
third at best).

You are not a large multi-million dollar company (at least I don't think
you are given that you're reading this book). So you don't have the
customer acquisition/marketing budget to beat this $4,000 annual
average. Period.

You succeed in the mobile space by building many niche, high quality
games. Trying to gain traction with using a wide net/with the general
populace, is like winning the lottery (Flappy Bird, Crossy Road,
etc). If you make a generic game that's a copy of what's already out
there, it's unlikely you will succeed.

Do not spend more than two months building the first version of your
product. Put it out there soon, get feedback from reviews, iterate on
a steady six week cadence. Market directly to your niche audience
(find the forums, online groups, in person groups that represent your audience).

One game won't make you rich. Hell, three games won't make you rich
(this is coming from someone that had a game at the #1 spot for 18
days straight, and three games in the top #100 apps overall). Build
many games (more than ten) that have a consistent, polished style that
represents _you_ as a game dev. And follow Xzibit's advice:

>Yo dawg. Cross promote your games, in your games, to get people to buy all the
>games you made, that you promoted within your games.

To put it another way. Release one game, and find X people to buy
it. Then make another game. Chances are (if communicated/marketed
correctly), those loyal to you, will buy your other game too. Keep
making good stuff that cater to _this_ group (the one that _also_
bought your _second_ game), and they'll continue buying what you
build.

Also, don't quit your job trying to make it as a game developer unless
you can live with no income for a long time. I repeat, don't blindly
"follow you passion". It won't end well (the last thing I need is
another suicidal email from a game dev that tried to follow in my
footsteps... yes this has happened more than once). I had over $100,000
in liquidity before quitting my job to pursue what I love to do. I got
a college education, saved for _ten_ years, lived well below my means,
and got rid of all my debt. Only then did I feel I was to a point
where I could take some time off and explore what I really wanted to
do with my life. Even then, a whole boat load of luck was involved,
and the constant "shit I need to find a job now" threat is ever
looming till this day (December 2016).

## The Rest of the Advice on How to Read This Book ##

This book is separated into three main parts, plus some fluff. If
you're pressed for time. Read part two immediately, read the
postmortems end the end of each chapter in part one, then read the rest
at your leisure.

The **fluff chapters** were written after emails from game devs and fans over the
last three years. Some of these chapters are to inspire, some are to
help beginners, and some are to give you a reality check.

- Redefining Success
- Get Started with Game Dev When You Don't Know How to Code
- Making Your Apps Accessible to the Blind
- I'd Give Anything

The **first part** of the book are the developer logs of A Dark Room. I
went back through all of them, and reevaluated what I observed then,
with the experience I've gained from doing this for three years. If
you're pressed for time, read the postmortems at the end of each log
and then decide if you want to read the original dev entry.

- Building A Dark Room
- Marketing A Dark Room
- A Dark Room Goes Viral

The **second part** of the book are essays with extremely valuable
pieces of advice/knowledge gained over my time as a mobile game
dev. I've ordered them for you from most important to least important
(again, if you're pressed for time).

- Build Games for Mobile
- Making Small, Sustainable Income
- How to Price Your App
- The Ins And Outs of the Review and Ranking System
- How to Market Your Game on Reddit
- How to Contact Apple About Your Game
- App Store vs Google Play

The **third part** of the book are interviews with other indie game
devs, editors for mobile gaming websites, and other types of content
creators. Each one provides a unique perspective of the mobile
landscape and how to succeed (or fail with style).

For those that don't have time to read the interviews. The general
advice is:

- Build small and quickly.
- Stay true to who you are.
- All of this is hard work.
- Luck plays a huge factor.
- Be genuine when talking to others (don't be a sleazeball, ass wipe marketer).

# Redefining Success

Success, unfortunately, is a moving target. My own success in the App
Store started off with:

>Awesome, I shipped! Holy crap I got some downloads!

Today it's:

>Damn, my apps only grossed $15k this quarter. After taxes, royalties, and
>partnerships distributions, I only netted $5k. That's near poverty
>level in the US for a two person household. I'm screwed.

Everyone has their form of this internal monologue:

>I can't believe X got so much noterity. My game Y is so much
>better. I put my heart and soul into it and this shoddy rendition
>"makes it"?!

I've been on the receiving end of this kind of frustration, here's
part of an email I've received when someone stumbled upon one of my
Reddit posts:

>I've decided to make an idle game. But a good one. A damn good
>one. Something never seen before. And use the income from this trash -
>to fund games I actually would enjoy making. Such as [New Game X]
>perhaps. I've decided to sculpt in shit, in order to eventually sculpt
>in pure gold. It wasn't easy, mind you.

>So I've almost finished this Idle game. And then...
>...I've bumped your reddit thread. And I am worried. Because this
>time, it might be too much for me to handle. To digest.

>Viral is one thing. But I've always thought of viral as spotlight. And
>spotlight only. So the game has to be good. Otherwise the viral
>effect/spotlight will backfire and actually do more harm than
>good. Well, apparently - I am wrong. Your game is not that bad. Its
>so-so. Decent at best. I've seen worse, I've seen better. But such a
>"decent" game generating so much commotion and income? On a mobile
>platform? In a "paid" model? It did almost all the things from the
>"Forbidden List of Don't". I give up.

**How can I redefine success so that I stop thinking like this?**

## Wealth

I've tried my best in reframing "rich" as a function of time, money,
and quality. So ask yourself the question:

>How long can I maintain my current standard of living without working
>a nine to five?

The premise here is that time and standard of living is a component of
wealth (as opposed to just money). Whose wealthier?

- Someone making $10,000 a month working 50 hours a week, with a cost
  of living at $9,000.

- Someone making $6,000 a month working 20 hours a week, with a cost
  of living at $4,000.

- Someone making $3,000 a month working zero hours a week, with a cost
  of living at $3,000.

Sometimes lowering your cost of living and the amount of
time you work, will increase your wealth. Game development can
be an unending, volatile cycle of feast and famine. For 2016, my projections put
me at netting about $40,000 off of my current mobile games. Which
isn't a lot of money for a two person, two doggies (yes, I said doggies)
household. But if I say:

>My mobile games net me $40,000 if I do _absolutely nothing_, and I
>can live off of $36,000 a year.

Suddenly, I'm wealthier than the person who makes $150,000 a year
living paycheck to paycheck.

Like an idiot, I went whole hog into game development in 2013. I
decided to live off of my savings that I had been stuffing away for
seven years. I got lucky and managed to hit the #1 spot in the App
Store. If I looked strictly at the money, I would have been better off
keeping my day job (even with that kind of success).

But, I think about it... and if I _did_ keep my day job... I'd be at
work in a cubical wearing a buttoned down shirt and slacks. But
instead, I'm sitting on my patio on a Friday, watching my two puppies
roll around in the grass. And I get to take a nap when 3 o'clock rolls
around. So sure, I could be making $140,000 a year right now, but at
what cost to time and quality of life?

## Reframe Money

My poorest performing game makes about $600 a year. That's nothing when
we talk about dollars, but when I say:

>I get free access to high speed internet. And I don't have to do
>anything for it.

Suddenly, it's much more positive and valuable. This type of reframing
is incredibly important for your mental health. The fancy term for
this "find the silver lining" is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. I try
my best to do this with every one of my income generating assets:

>Hey, [Game X] pays for my meals.

>Sweet, [This One Thing I Built] covered a couple of car payments.

It's important to note that I actually enjoy the work that I
do. At that point, income is just icing on the cake.

## Screw the Joneses

Stuff for the sake of status is poison. I drive down the streets in my
city and see billboards advertising 4000+ sqft mini mansions for
$400k. Who needs that kind of space? What's the point of buying a
house like that, filling it with stuff, then spending the next 30
years paying it off by working/commuting 50 hours a week?

This infatuation with "Keeping up with the Joneses" takes us away from
doing what we love (building games). What's more important? Sitting
exhausted on the weekends flipping through 200 channels on your 70
inch TV? Or having the time to explore and create _every day_ in your
humble one/two bedroom apartment? Who's more successful?

## Stop Comparing

Please don't be like the person from the email at the beginning. I get
that some are dealt a bad hand in life. But you only make it worse for
yourself by comparing it to other's successes. Take some time and
reflect on what is really important to you. What will make you
happy, how do you want to spend your time (something you can never get
back), and how much money do you really need to pursue it.

# Get Started with Game Dev When You Don't Know How to Code

**tl;dr;**

It can be paralyzing when you look at how to get started. What
language do you learn? What framework should you use? What editor
should you use? What network/server stack should you use? How much will
all this cost?

Well, here's the answer: Use JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and
Canvas (Pixi.js) for your front end. Use Sublime Text 2 for your
editor. Use NodeJS for your back end. Use Heroku for your host (it's
free).

The emphasis with this development stack is on an incredibly fast
feedback loop. JavaScript deemphasizes type theory, performance, and
memory management. For your first game, you really don't have to worry
about this stuff. With these advanced concepts deemphasized, you can
concentrate on just getting familiar with programming and getting your
ideas on a page that you can show off.

**inb4**

>Just use [Unity](https://unity3d.com), it's easy.

>Just use [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/blog), it's easy.

Two things:

1) You can make wonderful things with
[insert awesome framework, widely advertised platform]. But, at the
end of the day, these are all complex beasts with their own unique
takes on how to approach game development (using their Integrated
Development Environments, language, and programming constructs). When
you're just starting with game development, it is incredibly
overwhelming to navigate these IDE's. So, for now, hold off on these
platforms. It's just too much to take in when making your first game.

2) Brick walls are rampant in these framework. You end up watching a 5
minute tutorial video and see how you can "Create this awesome 3D FPS
by just dragging and dropping stuff and 5 lines of code!". You follow
the video, and get their sample up and running... but then what? A lot
of the demo videos out there go for "wow factor" as opposed to
teaching fundamentals.

To elaborate on this: A friend of mine went into the digital arts. The
first things he was told to do by his professor was to draw a perfect
circle and straight line by hand. Can you imagine how boring that
would be to practice? My friend saw all the glam and glory with being
godlike with Photoshop, he gets to class bright eyed and bushy
tailed, and is told to bring out a piece of paper and a pencil to
draw rudimentary shapes. Every craft is like this. You have to have a
good grasp of fundamentals before you can start using tools to augment
that solid foundation. Large frameworks with "batteries included"
don't teach you these fundamentals (they teach you how to use _their_
product).

>Your recommendation of JavaScript (jQuery), HTML, CSS, Canvas, etc
>is terrible. No real games use these frameworks.

You can get pretty damn far using this tech stack. Here is a Dive Kick
clone I made in about a week:
[Gameplay Gif](https://gfycat.com/SingleJauntyAmazonparrot),
[Source Code](http://github.com/amirrajan/nodekic).

Look, I'll be the first to say that JavaScript is a _terrible_ language. It
was built in 10 days, by a guy in a basement, after he broke up with his
girlfriend. It has the most ridiculous value coercion issues I've ever
seen in a language (among other things). [This lighting talk by Gary
Bernhardt titled Wat
enumerates the sheer insanity of JavaScript](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat). But,
this stack that I'm recommending will give you an extremely fast
feedback loop. It'll let you get a grasp of some programming
_fundamentals_, and then provide you a bridge to a "real" game
development stack.

>You don't need learn to code to build a game. I just used th-

Yes. You do.

>No really, you can get pretty far without knowing how to program if you
>j-

No. Stop. You need to have a good grasp of fundamentals. You can't
short cut this process (if you try you'll hit that wonderful brick wall).

## Words of Warning

**Coding Isn't Easy**

You have got to work at it. I started dabbling with computers when I
was in 8th grade (1997-98). I had to learn how to code using Turbo
C++, Visual Basic, a shit IBM Aptiva, and a library card (get off my lawn). You
whippersnappers just don't know how easy you have it with regards to
instant access to resources.

With the world at your fingertips, it still takes an
immense amount of practice, trial/error, and persistence to really get
the hang of coding. You just can't learn this stuff in a short period
of time. Coding didn't really click for me until I was a Senior in
highschool. You have to comb through the same concepts over and over
again. And frankly, no one will hold your hand. As with this entry,
I'm going to point you to some resources, give you some simple
programs to make, but it's up to _you_ to read, ask questions online,
and do the work.

**Coding is a Lifetime of Learning**

Coding, game development, software development (any craft) requires a
lifetime of learning. Every time I look up, some new
framework/language/network stack has come out (and needs to be
learned). It's an endless cycle of feeling like a god, to feeling like
a complete idiot, and back again. You'll face countless hurdles to get
something working, everything will be rainbows and unicorns for a
split second, and then you'll be confronted with another set of
hurdles to overcome. Once you feel you've figured everything out, you
find that a new game-changing tech is just over the horizon... sending
you back to square one. If you don't love doing that, this is the
wrong profession for you.

## Setting Up Your Environment

These steps will hopefully get you over the first few hurdles of
game development. All this is completely free. So don't worry about
having to pay if you can't afford to.

Download [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2): this is a
very nice looking editor and will be plenty sufficient for the code
you'll be writing here.

Register a username on [GitHub](http://github.com): all the code I
will point you to is on GitHub. This is where you'll "back up" all of
your source code. When you register on GitHub, use a professional
username. You can consider this as your public portfolio that
potential employers may look at.

Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/): this is the language/runtime
you'll use to work through the programming problems below.

Install [Redis](http://redis.io): The
[Windows Install](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis/releases) can be
a little tricky. So if you can't get it to work, don't worry about it
just yet.

Install
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html):
This (and Firefox) are the browsers for developers. The thought of
supporting Internet Explorer and Safari give me nightmares (the former
more so than the latter).

## Your First "Games"

Create a file on your desktop called `index.html`, and
put the following lines in it:

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My Game</title>
        <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.0.min.js"></script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="hello-world" style="display: none">
          Hello World
        </div>

        <button id="click-me-button">click me</button>

      </body>
      <script>
       $(function() {
         $("#click-me-button").click(function() {
           $("#hello-world").show();
         });
       });
      </script>
    </html>

Open the file up in Chrome and see the magic happen.

Great! Now,
[using the resources here](http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/). Complete
the following programs. You'll need to Google, use StackOverflow,
read, read some more, and try writing stuff. I'd recommend skimming
all the content on learn.jquery.com frankly (especially
[Events](http://learn.jquery.com/events/) and [Effect](http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-basics/).

Remember the story I told about my friend having to draw a circle and
a straight line before he could use Photoshop? Well this is your
(boring) trial by fire.

###"Game" Number One

Write an html page that has an `input` text box, with a `placeholder`
asking the user to enter their name. After they have entered their
name, the user can click a button. Once the button is clicked, an
`alert` box pops us saying "Hello, [Name]".

Enhance the webpage so that "Name is required." is displayed in the
`alert` box if the user doesn't enter a name.

Enhance the webpage so that instead of throwing up an `alert` box, a red
error text is displayed above the text box, if they fail to enter a
name.

Enhance the webpage so that instead of throwing up an alert box for
saying hello, text is displayed on the page in green (below the text box).

### "Game" Number Two

Write an html page that shows a `table` with 3 rows and 3 columns. When
a user clicks in any of the table cells, the color of the cell changes from
white to black.

Enhance the program to toggle between white and black. If a white cell
is clicked, it turns black. If a black cell is clicked, it turns white.

Enhance the program to print out all the colors of each square after a
square has been clicked (below the table in an `unordered list`). For example:

    - Row 0, Column 0 is white.
    - Row 0, Column 1 is black.
    - Row 0, Column 2 is black.
    - etc.

Enhance the program such that if all squares in a row are black, the
`unordered list` contains an "All squares in row X are black." entry
(along with color information for each square).

Enhance the program such that if all squares in a column are black, it
prints out "All squares in column X are black." (along with color
information for each square).

Enhance the program such that if diagonals are black it prints out
either "The left to right diagonal is black." or "The right to left
diagonal is black." or "Both diagonals are black." (along with color
information for each square).

Can you make this into Tic Tac Toe? Do that now. Break down the
problem step by step like I did for you. Seriously, do not move onto
the next program until you've built a fully functional Tic Tac Toe
game with win conditions (you don't have to worry about creating an
AI, just assume it's two players).

### "Game" Number Three

Write an html page that shows a table with 10 rows and 10
columns. Clicking on a column adds a black square to the _top_ row of
that column (regardless of what row within the column is clicked).

Using JavaScript's `setInterval` function. Every 1000 milliseconds, black squares
should "drop down" a row until they hit the bottom row, or another black square.

If an entire column is filled with black squares, all black squares in the
column are removed.

Save the current state of the game to `localStorage`. This means that
if I close the page and bring it back up, the grid will be just the
way I left it.

Make this into a two player Connect Four with win conditions.

Make this into Tetris like game where you control 2 by 2
squares that drop from the top randomly. Use [keymaster.js](https://github.com/madrobby/keymaster) for keyboard input.

Doing these exercises are important. It'll help you create realistic
time lines for your future projects. It's very hard for a seasoned
developer to take someone seriously when they say:

>I'm just starting to get into game development. I'm thinking of
>making a MMORPG. I'm setting my timeline to two months. I should be
>able to get it done. How hard can it really be? Any tips on getting started?

In all honesty, I think it'll take you about that time to just create
Tic Tac Toe, Connect Four, and Square Tetris (if you're coming at this
with no development experience). So power through and finish "drawing
these circles and lines". It'll put much larger endeavors into
perspective.

## Learn How To Deploy Your Stuff

Now that you have some familiarity with JavaScript, HTML, and
CSS, let's deploy some prebuilt apps. Each app comes with a
`README`. So follow the steps and see if you can get it out there. Then
after deploying, study and dissect the code. Go through these
codebases line by line and make sure you understand _everything_ that's
in them. Maybe try to expand these apps and create your own games (all
of this stuff is released under permissive licenses, so go wild).

## Word Finder

This app lets you search the entire English dictionary for words that
match a specific pattern. It's a great little website that will "help"
you in games such as Words with Friends. Warning, don't use this to beat
your significant other. It won't end well. Speaking from personal
experience.

Word Finder is a pretty bare bones app. There is enough non-trivial code
in here for you to get a grasp on the structure of a NodeJS app, and
how you can do something useful with the platform. It uses a lean and
powerful web framework called Express and a light weight templating
engine called EJS.

[Instructions and source code](https://github.com/amirrajan/word-finder)

## Celebrity Chat

A simple chat app. Each person that comes to the page gets assigned
the name of a celebrity. You can chat with each other. Role play. Keep
it PG.

This app shows, what I feel, is the killer feature of NodeJS:
websockets. The code is fairly simple. It exchanges a few messages
with server and client in realtime. The libraries used are Express,
EJS and a websockets library called Socket.io.

[Instructions and source code](https://github.com/amirrajan/nodejs-chat)

## Cards Against Humanities

This is a port of the game Cards Against Humanities. It’s released
under Creative Commons Non-Commercial.

This app shows a non-trivial (but still simple) usage of
Socket.io. It's also mobile friendly and has fallbacks in place for
clients that have a "not so reliable" internet connection. There is
also a test suite associated with this code base using a library
called jasmine-node. [Get 3 other friends and play it here](http://nahnahnah.herokuapp.com).

[Instructions and source code](https://github.com/amirrajan/nodejs-against-humanity)

## Dive Kick Clone

This is a real time, multiplayer fighting game [currently hosted
here](http://node-kick.herokuapp.com). This codebase is a cleaned up
version of what our team built for Node Knockout 2013. Out of 385
teams, we placed 15th overall and 6th in the "fun/utility" category.

The app shows a non-trivial usage of Socket.io and an HTML5 canvas
framework called Pixi.js. The app shows how you can share common code
on the server and client (in this case the "physics" engine). It also
shows how you can use interpolation techniques to handle updates to
clients for a game that runs at 60 frames per second. You'll also get
some insight on how to create "good" NodeJS modules (when to use
JavaScript in a class centric format vs a functional format). The
commit history is fairly clean. Step through the commit history to see
how the app evolved over time.

[Instructions and source code](https://github.com/amirrajan/nodekick)

### Learn Pixi.js

The last app in the list above was created using
[Pixi.js](http://pixijs.com). Here is where you're pretty much
on your own. Go through
[the examples they have on their website](http://pixijs.github.io/examples/), and
try to build a very simple Tic Tac Toe and Tetris game.

### Learn Some Math

Knowing a little bit of Trig and Geometry can go a long way. Understanding
SOHCAHTOA and whether two rectangles intersect was all I needed to
develop [A Noble Circle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPzpfDgofu0).

## Tips Moving Forward

If you were able to get through these items. You're to a point where
you have a cursory grasp of what it takes to build a video
game. Honestly, you don't need to know a whole lot to make something
really great.

So here are some tips moving forward.

**Build Small and Iterate**

If you have a game idea, you need to have something playable in 2 to
3 weeks. Any time frame larger than this is absolutely insane for
one man/two man teams. After you get something playable, then you
can iterate on that and go for bigger goals. Don't toil away on
your game. It's so ridiculously easy to get something out there with
free hosting options/websites. So just get something out there in
the public.

For the Dive Kick clone, a team of four of us had
something playable in a weekend. Once you get the hang of this fast
prototyping spikes, you'll find that it's fairly effortless to vet a
game mechanic (and see if it shows promise).

**Learn How to Ask Questions**

Learn how to ask questions. One of the most infuriating things about
receiving a question about problem X is a generic vague
statement. For example:

>How to make an atm machine on python using functions, please help me.
>The balance should be written to a file so the next time the user logs in the balance stays the same.
>I have no idea how to start this so a start would be very useful!
>Thanks.

I (and I'm sure others) have a visceral response to this kind of
blurb. The person doesn't say what he's tried. He doesn't give any
information about what his current thought process is, or what he's
Googled for already. There is no indication that the person has taken
any time on his own to figure things out.

[Here is an example of how to ask a good question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17600466/using-dynamicobject-idynamicmetaobjectprovider-as-a-component-of-a-static-type). In
here I:

- State the problem and explain the motivation behind it.
- Give a means to recreate the issue in a contrived way.
- I show what I tried, what worked, what didn't.
- I ask for a specific insight.

Communication skills (like asking questions and technical writing)
will set you apart from the rest of the herd. So start working on
these things.

**Practice Twenty Minutes a Day**

Get an egg timer. Set it to countdown from twenty minutes, and write
some code. Anything. If you don't know what to write, register an
account on [Code Wars](http://www.codewars.com/), skim through some
problems, find one that looks interesting, and work on them twenty
minutes at a time.

You may be in a situation where you can't do programming full time. If
it's something you really want to persue, you have to build up the
habit. Keep improving your development skills by doing these small
problems (or working on your next idea).

**Learn Other Languages**

As I said before, JavaScript is the red headed step child of
languages. Learning other languages will give your brain some
exercise. Here are
some examples:

- Object Oriented, Statically Typed: C# 5.0, Java 8.0
- Object Oriented, Dynamically Typed: Ruby, Python
- Functional, Statically Typed: F#, Haskell, Swift
- Functional, Dynamically Typed: Clojure, Erlang
- Low Level: Go, C, C++, Objective C
- Transpiled: ES6 (JavaScript 2015), ClojureScript, Elm, PureScript
- Specialized: R, APL

SYou want to learn different _types_ of languages. For example: if you
already know Python, you probably wont gain much from learning Ruby.

All these languages may not be _directly_ applicable to game
development. But they'll give you different ways of thinking about a
problem domain. The best analogy I can think of is:

- A musical composer can't make the best score unless he understands
  how to play a lot of different instruments.
- A good League of Legends player has familiarity with all the
  champions, and knows their pros and cons (even though he only
  prefers to play with a handful).

**Stay Hungry**

You have to really dig in and want to work at this stuff. If you feel
the interest tapering, take some time to reflect. Coding isn't
for everyone, there may be other creative outlets that are better
suited for your personality.

# Building A Dark Room

These are detailed developer logs that I've kept from the beginning of
A Dark Rooms inception though its climb the the number one spot. I
also cover the long tail of games that I released after A Dark
Room. Each developer entry has a short postmortem (along with a
reference to one of the chapters in this book if a deeper dive is needed).

For context (and to avoid major spoilers), it's probably best to actually
play A Dark Room all the way through. I'll put screenshots in here so
that will help, but screenshots can only do the game so much justice
(no different than cliff notes for a book). A Dark Room will take
anywhere from an hour and half to three hours to complete. So, take
the time and do so :-).

Guys and gals, as indie game developers, we're in this together. We
have to support each other (so thank you for buying this book and my
games). If you ever have a question, email me at ar@amirrajan.net.

## Day 1 - Jul 1, 2013: Picking the Development Environment ##

Starting off, I knew I didn't want to write an app in Objective C and
XCode again. During my time off, I had already built apps using
Objective C, Interface Builder, and XCode. I _wanted_ the experience
in building an app using the "recommended" development
environment... It was just not fun. I've spent too much time with
bloated IDE's and visual designers. I didn't want to experience that
again.

My first few lines of A Dark Room code were still in Objective C via
XCode. After a day of coding, I got fed up with the environment. I had
a copy of RubyMotion sitting on my virtual shelf. I put aside my fears
of "using something that isn't supported by Apple", dusted it off, and
started building the app in RubyMotion instead.

I coded for 12 hours straight on the game. I haven't had this feeling
in a very long time... losing track of time like that.

**Postmortem**

Picking an environment to work in becomes pretty important. Assuming
you are a one-man/two-man shop, I feel it's important to actually
enjoy what you're working in. XCode and Objective C was not that. When
I started building A Dark Room, Swift wasn't a language that was
available to me. I still wonder if I would have chosen RubyMotion over
Swift (assuming I didn't know much about either at the time). After
all is said and done. RubyMotion has won my heart over. The most
important aspect of choosing a stack to work in is the community. Is
it cohesive? When you ask questions, do you get a response quickly?
And most importantly (for me and I'd expect the main audience for my
book), do they care for the little guy as much as the big development
shop.

If you are on you first game. I'd personally start with a 2D game
engine. Attempting to learn a 3D game engine and all the intricacies
for a complex physics and modeling system is a sure fire way to never
have a game built. You may even want to start with just wrapping a web
page in your app and just use Html and JavaScript. Start small.

## Day 7 - Jul 7, 2013: A Week Later. First Playtest by a "Non-Gamer" ##

I got huts working and had implemented population growth. The game was
far from complete. But I took the chance and showed it to a non
gamer. They were thoroughly confused. But slowly got pulled into the
game and had built "a tiny village". I consistently heard "it needs
pictures, it needs visuals". I actually thought about adding black and
white background images to the game that would change as the player
progressed... but I wanted to have a complete game before adding my
own creativity to it.

**Postmortem**

Here is a screenshot of what the game looked like at this point vs
what it looks like today.

![Buy Screen After](manuscript/images/current-build.png)

Outside Screen Before/After

![Outside Before](manuscript/images/d9-outside.png)

![Outside After](manuscript/images/current-outside.png)

Aside from adding a bit more symmetry to all the screens (and making
buttons bigger for larger fingers), the general look and feel of the
game stayed the same.  It's incredibly important to stay true to your
style, even when people say otherwise. Generalizing your game
mechanics and trying to appease everyone will just lead to a diluted
experience that won't satisfy anyone. I cover this idea of creating
niche apps in the chapter titled: Making Small, Sustainable Income.

A couple of tips when beta testing:

1. Learn to avoid feedback you don't need (for me it was \"it needs
   pictures\"). Try to understand why they are giving you that
   feedback. Read up on the 5 Whys on Wikipedia. See my chapter
   called: Genin Tsuikyu (Root Cause Analysis) for an interesting bit
   of creative writing.

2. Try to do your beta testing in person. Watch the tester play the
   game. If they do something surprising, ask why they did X vs Y. For
   in person testing, pick a new person every time (having fresh eyes
   on your game is incredibly important).

3. Don't use up all your beta tests all at once. If you release your
   game to all of your beta testers, then you'll probably end up
   getting the same feedback from all of them, and then no subsequent
   feedback when you make updates. So just release the game to one or
   two people at a time, ramping up as you get closer to completion.

**Day 12 - Jul 12, 2013: Road Blocks**

I hit my first road block. When I reached out to Michael about porting
the game to iOS, I actually hadn't finished playing the web version. I
never bought the compass to set out onto the Dusty Path. I thought I
was making extremely good progress, but then I saw the complexity of
the outside world. The economy management part of the game, that I had
been coding on, was just the tip of the iceberg.

The Dusty Path was really hard to fit on a small screen. It took me 10
days to figure out how to approach the next part of the game. I made
tiny sample apps and tried different variations of pinch and zoom
techniques, scrolling techniques, "follow the player" techniques, and
skeuomorphic stuff. Before this day I thought I was so close to
finishing the implementation of game...

**Postmortem**

I still to this day deal with Imposter Syndrome. A Dark Room was an
amazing success, but was it because of my complete redesign or am I
kidding myself and simply standing on the shoulders of a giant
(Michael). My two other games haven't done as well as A Dark Room
(financially). But they are completely my own and both have a near
perfect five star rating. I've been doing this on and off for three
years now and I still feel like I can't get out from under the shadow
of ADR.

A lot of the rework for A Dark Room was getting it to work on a mobile
medium. It was originally a web based idle game that was designed to
be left alone most of the time (not actively played/played in
bursts). I wanted to create an experience that kept you from leaving
your screen until you finished. Try playing the web version of the game
located at
[http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/](http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/)
side by side with the iOS version.

As for building games for mobile read the chapter titled: Build Games
for Mobile.

**Day 21 - Jul 21, 2013: I Want to Stab Cocoa UI In the Face**

I settled on a "follow the player" implementation where the map would
center when the player moved on the map. You could scroll around the
map if you needed, but as soon as you moved again, it would refocus to
your current location. I had to use two layers of overlapping labels
to represent landmarks and terrain (Cocoa UILabels can only have one
format/font). It took 5 days to get the labels lined up and scrolling
correctly. Fifteen days, just gone on trying to display a map.

**Postmortem**

Nothing really to add here that wasn't covered in Day 12. But here is
a screenshot of the Dusty Path as it existed then and now.

![Dusty Path before](manuscript/images/d21-world.png)

![Dusty Path now](manuscript/images/current-world.png)


**Day 26 - Jul 26, 2013: Making the iOS Version My Own**

At this point I needed to take a break from the Dusty Path and do some
polish and play testing. The pacing in the game was an issue. It was
too slow to get started. I didn't know if it was because I had played
it so many times, or if the game was actually just too slow to get
going on a mobile medium.

I decided to add Friedrich Nietzsche quotes that would show up
randomly when you stoked the fire (to give the player something to
read through the slower points in the game). This didn't make it into
the final release, but were in the game for a while. I had accumulated
200 quotes and felt that it was inline with the atmosphere of the game.

## Day 28 - Jul 28, 2013: Creativity is a Drug ##

I don't know what it was about these Nietzsche quotes. I think it was
my first attempt at doing something different and
creative... something that set A Dark Room iOS apart from the web
version. I spent the day incorporating quotes, thinking to myself how
awesome it would be and how eerie it would make the game. Here are
some of them:

>every profound spirit needs a mask: even more, around every profound spirit a mask is continually growing.

>when you stare into the abyss the abyss stares back at you.

>a dictator divides mankind into two classes: tools and enemies.

To help again with pacing, I decided to add "flashes of events" that
would show up when the player gathered wood. It added just enough of a
draw to keep going though the first part. The first message
read:

>hope she's okay, have to keep the fire going.

**Postmortem**

The "flashes of events" was an incredibly important turning point for
the game. It's where I took the world Michael created and put my own
touch of narrative. The "builder" of A Dark Room is by far the most
important component to the narrative. I'd go as far to say that she
_is_ the narrative. I don't think the game would have been as
successful without her and the player's unspoken relationship.

Here are some code metrics for the size of the game at this
point. You'd think a minimalist text based game would be tiny, but
that certainly wasn't the case.

Game Size at Day 28:

- code: 3,584

Final Game Size:

- blank: 3,855
- comment: 291
- code: 16,506

The quotes were in place. I had random Room events working too. The
after effects created from spending so many days with wrestling the
map had worn off. I started specing out the battle sequences
now.

For the business/non technical people reading this, I can't stress
enough how difficult this time period was. It's not fun hitting
roadblock after roadblock. You make some progress, see parts of a
system coming together and then immediately hit another problem. It's
one of the reasons I had to take a step away from the Dusty Path back
in Day 26.

So when your developer friends are in this slog, the last thing they
need to hear is "Why isn't this done yet?", or "I'm surprised this is
taking so long." Try to empathize with the developers, because we've
got enough problems to deal with during these times.

One technique I would recommend is ask the your devs if you can be a
"rubber duck" for them. It's simple to be a rubber duck. Just sit with
them as they code and let them explain to you the lines they are
working on. You don't have to understand anything, just be someone
that asks the naive questions. "What does this part do?". Nod, let
them just talk out loud to you about their reasoning about different
parts of the code base. Just be someone they can talk to out loud
with. That's the best way for you to help the dev team when their in
this kind of situation.

**Day 33 - Aug 2, 2013: Had to Take Another Break**

Development on A Dark Room started to slow down a bit (I hit a bit of
a low point in motivation). Combat was working at a cursory
level... mostly just animations. The battle sequence was pretty much a
real time game with a timer running at 10 frames per second... I was
making a real time game using Cocoa controls as opposed to sprites and
a canvas... kind of felt weird about that. But it worked.

5 days on and off to work through the loot screen (the screen that
came up after you won a battle). Pixel pushing labels and buttons. At
this point I dread any kind of UI work in iOS.

**Postmortem**

For those that are just getting into game development. The explanation
above is important. I was making a game out of buttons, labels, ascii
characters, and progress bars. No crazy 3D engine, hell, not even a 2D
engine. Just stupid controls that you would use to build a business
application. Keep this in mind when you feel this paralyses in
getting started/deciding what to use. Start with a simple idea/game
mechanic and use the most primitive means necessary to get your idea
on a digital medium.

**Day 58 - Aug 25, 2013: Taking a Break to Scratch a NodeJS Itch**

I've spent the last 8 days on the Dusty Path. Adding the Iron Mine,
Coal Mine, Sulfur Mine, working through road creation, and working
through unlocking Workshop items. I needed another break. I spent the
next week working on a Twitter mashup written in NodeJS among other
things. You can find the projects here: [http://amirrajan.net/nodejs-by-example/](http://amirrajan.net/nodejs-by-example/).

**Postmortem**

If you want to make an Html and Javascript game, take a look at
Pixi.js. It's my go to game engine for web games.

Also, August 25th is my birthday... you can buy yourself A Dark Room, The Ensign,
and A Noble Circle as a birthday gift to me :-D

**Day 108 - Sep 19, 2013: The Slog Continues**

Development of the game continues. Play testing and tweaking the Dusty
Path. I was just a grumpy person this month in general with all the
annoying pixel pushing. I spent some time reflecting on all the
different things I've done on my sabbatical. A Dark Room had been my
primary "work" throughout this time. But I continued to spend time
working with other stacks.

**Postmortem**

Dealing with stress is difficult. Dealing with the ups and downs of
any type of creative work is difficult. You generally feel alone
because no one understands what you are truly going through. And when
you try to explain it to people, you end up feeling belittled. Read
this chapter for a deeper dive into this topic: Dealing With Stress.

## Day 119 - Oct 1, 2013: The Play Testing Grind... This is Not Fun ##

All of September went to the Dusty Path (and being a grumpy
developer). I made sure all the different city and town events showed
up. I made sure the workshop items and workers unlocked correctly. I
made sure map state rolled back if the player dies.

I chatted with Michael about this. How the hell he managed to test all
this... He did what I did, just grinded through it. I spent 2 days
creating an automated test suite. It tested all the different random
paths the events could take. Glad I did that. Even with all the manual
testing, I still had a number of bugs.

**Day 137 - Oct 19, 2013: A Dusty Path Complete**

The Dusty Path is finally to a point where all the events work and the
spaceship can be unlocked. I have saving working too. A number of my
friends and family have play tested the game to this point
(and have frankly gotten sick of it).

During this time period I removed the Nietzsche quotes. It just led to
confusion and the pacing was good enough with the "gather wood
storyline events". Reading all those quotes helped shape the storyline
I put in place.

Particularly this quote:

>a dictator divides mankind into two classes: tools and enemies.

There was a specific lull in the gameplay. The time between buying the
compass and then building the Smokehouse, Tannery, and Workshop was
still a bit of a wait. This is where I decided to shift the story to
take a turn for the worse. Through the creation of these three
buildings, the player would slowly see that the villagers were being
overworked. And finally, the villagers became
slaves:

>the villagers...i can see the fatigue in their eyes...

>back breaking labor...the villagers are mine to command...

>leather for finer things, must push the villagers...

>i'll make the villagers work...day and night...they are my slaves...

After the game released, I had a number of people literally reset the
game at this point... or simply stop gathering wood because they
didn't want their villagers to turn into slaves. I didn't expect this
kind of visceral reaction to the events. We murder in video games all
the time. We vandalize. We steal cars. We stomp on the heads of
turtles and mushrooms that never did anything to us. Why did the slave
event cause people to stop playing?

I hate you Michael (in a good way). You didn't build a single
game. You built 3 games and stitched them together in a brilliant
way. The ship scene was the next thing to tackle. There was an end in
sight. The largest part of the game (The Dusty Path) was done.

**Day 141 - Oct 23, 2013: Space Sequence Complete. The Meeting With Michael.**

I couldn't believe it. I had a fully functioning game from beginning
to end. I knew I had a number of things to polish. But the game was
"code complete". Around this time I emailed Michael to set up a video
conference (he lives in Canada.. I live in Dallas, Tx). I can't
believe that all the communication up until this point was done
through email and chat.

Michael hadn't seen the storyline additions I made. I was worried he'd
say "no" to the changes. It wasn't a lot of work to rip it out, but it
was definitely something I felt contributed greatly to the experience
of A Dark Room. It made the player feel anxious, uneasy, even worried
to continue the game at times.

This is a testament to how kind and open to ideas Michael is. He
appreciated the changes I made to the storyline, and loved the
enhancements I made to the mobile version of the game. It was as
simple as that. He just said, "That's awesome! I like it!"

Suffice to say that a huge weight was lifted off of my shoulders. We
got to talking in fact about the intricacies of the game. I mentioned
that most of the game could have been played without any villagers if
iron, coal and sulphur could be mined by the player. Michael said
"Hey, why don't you add that? Add a solo mode with an alternate ending?"

**Postmortem**

If you're going to build a game and try to survive the App
Store. Bring on a partner, even if they play a small role/own only a
small part. You need to have someone to bounce ideas off of and bitch
to. They are the one person that are "in it with you". In retrospect,
it's a good thing that Michael took an active role in the
development. He now handles all the legal and copyright infringement
stuff (so I can concentrate on marketing and the relationship with Apple).

**Day 149 - Oct 31, 2013: My Wife's Final Playtest**

The game is in its final form. My wife sits down and plays the game
for the 50th time. A number of my friends play tested the game. But I
really didn't want to ask too much of them. Most of them only
play tested the game once, at different points in the development
process. I was able to get feedback from them, and they were a
tremendous help (thank you Jason Smith, Eric Sowell, Kevin Wade, Matt
Florence, Tim Rayburn, Zahan Tariq, Christopher Krailo, Aaron
Lasseigne, and Chris Holt).

But my wife stands well above all the others that play tested. She
could have said she was tired of playing this game at any point, but
she didn't. She was the only person that, without hesitation, would
play through the game any time I asked. I handed the final game to her
at 10 pm that night. And she played the game non stop, all the way to
the end. It was 2 am when she completed the play through.
Thank you my dear.

**Postmortem**

Find someone that will play your game to the very end at a drop of a
hat. My wife received that task (she is married to me after all). I'd
bring the game over to her and she played it, no questions
asked... well she grumbled a little bit. But she knew how important it
was to me and obliged. Have people that can support you in building
your games.

**Day 150 - Nov 1, 2013: Submitted to the App Store at $1.99**

I submitted the game to the App Store. The description of the game was
set to "a text based journey... awake. head throbbing. vision blurry."
I still spent a day making minor tweaks to balancing. I play tested the
game another 4 times before releasing. My game times were pretty damn
fast at this point because I knew exactly what to do. I could beat the
game in 90 to 100 minutes without even thinking too hard. Now I just
have to wait. This was a good week. I shipped A Dark Room for iOS. And
I was now preparing for a NodeJS competition: Node Knockout 2013!

**Postmortem**

For Node Knockout 2013, I teamed up with three other devs and coded
for a weekend straight on a Div Kick clone. We used Html/Javascript
and Canvas controls. You can check out the fruits of our labor at
[http://github.com/amirrajan/node-kick](http://github.com/amirrajan/node-kick).

## Day 157 - Nov 8, 2013: One of the Worst Days of My Life ##

It took a full 7 days. But A Dark Room was finally in the App Store. I
downloaded the release version of the game on my iPhone 5 and was able
to play it. It was an unreal feeling given how much work was put in. I
know Michael tweeted about the release. I was hoping that many people
would tweet about the iOS version. It was 6 months since the Hacker
News post of A Dark Room. Everyone who upvoted the game probably have
forgotten about it by now. But maybe it would go viral like the web
version did.

The first reply to Michael's tweet came in. I was sick to my stomach:
"The game just crashes, I have an iPhone 5s". I screamed at the top of
my lungs, broke down, literally fell to my knees and cried. No one
wants to see that on their release day. No one should ever have that
happen to them. I tried my wife's iPhone 5s and it was crashing there
too. I texted my friend Eric Sowell and the game was also crashing for
him. At that moment I wished I never spent all that time building it.

I pulled myself together and put a debug build of A Dark Room on my
wife's iPhone. It crashed immediately with a runtime exception (the
error itself is a blur now, but I remember it having to do with
compilation flags). My assumption at this point was it had something
to do with 64 bit architecture of the new iOS devices.

I drove (sped) to the Apple Store in the Parks at Willow Bend Mall,
and bought an iPad Air to test out my theory. I sat at the food court,
took the iPad out. I loaded up the developer certs and deployed a
debug build of the app. It crashed there too. I ended up explicitly
setting the compilation flag to armv7 for all libraries
I was referencing. This fixed the debug build.

I repackaged the app and via iTunes Connect, requested an emergency
release of the app. Apple got back to me and approved the emergency
release. I pushed up version 1.1 of the app. Then I just had to
wait... nothing really I could do. I was taking part in a NodeJS
competition at the time. So that helped keep my mind off of it.

**Postmortem**

For all that is good in the world. Do a beta build of your game
distributed through iTunesConnect/Test Flight. Doing this would have
saved me from this terrible, terrible day. Before every release, I
make sure to do a beta release of your game, you need to deploy a
version with `beta-reports-active`. This will allow you to test your
game in it's "release" state, on a device that isn't a developer
device. Do this or risk living through the same thing I did.

Also, watch the Indie Game: The Movie on Netflix. It's a great look at
some of the struggles indie game devs go through (hits really close to
home, especially after this day one crash).

**Day 158 - Nov 9, 2013: The Crash Fix Shipped**

Over the weekend (during the NodeJS competition), I received an email
saying that version 1.1 of A Dark Room was ready for sale. That
moment, I asked Eric (he was also in the competition) to download the
updated version of the app. He started it up, and it worked.

I still have no idea why setting the compilation flag to armv7
worked. But I'm not about to change that now. To this day, it's still
extremely stressful deploying to the App Store. I have no idea if the
instant crash will come back. I can't recreate it using the simulators
either.

Our Node Knockout 2013 team: Team Us - As in "us" not "them", ended up
placing 15th overall and placed 6th in the fun/utility category.
Awesome experience.

**If You Build It, They Will Come is a Complete Utter Lie**

For all the asspiring game developers out there. The sad reality is
that building your amazing game isn't enough. You then have to spend
an immense amount of time telling people about it. The next chapter
shows this slog.

# Marketing A Dark Room

At this point, the major brunt of development is complete for A Dark
Room is complete. Approximately six months earlier, the web version of
ADR went viral. Twitter was filled with people references the website
url. I used that as a starting point for my marketing efforts. And
built from there.

## Day 159 - Nov 10, 2013: My Obsession with Twitter and @ADarkRoomiOS Begins ##

I created the @ADarkRoomiOS Twitter handle and started tweeting in the
persona of the game. The plan was to interact with anyone and everyone
who ever tweeted about the web version of the game. Having a daily
tweet from the game, showed that I wasn't just a random spam
bot... that there was a real person behind these tweets. I did a
Twitter search for "adarkroom" and began combing through all the
tweets... replying to anyone who mentioned the game. Letting them know
that there was an iOS version.

**Postmortem**

I'd say at a minimum, have a website for your game and a Twitter
handle where people can reach you at. I created my website a bit late
into the game and I'm sure I missed some opportunities to have a url
that could have been shared with people. Here are some samples of good
websites:

- http://amirrajan.net/games
- http://adarkroomios.com
- http://http://www.swordofxolan.com/
- http://www.robtopgames.com/

I used Jekyll hosted on GitHub. It's 100% free. So try to get
something out (even if it's just a simple landing page with
information on how to get in contact with you). Read the chapter: Tips
on a Public Presence.

**Day 164 - Nov 15, 2013: A Ray of Hope**

I've spent 5 days putting up daily tweets about A Dark Room. Reached
out to a few people on Twitter in the persona of the game. It was
fun. I got a couple of laughs and some people actually interacted with
me too. I liked building a relationship with the fans :-). Every
single morning I'd wake up and check the downloads of A Dark Room for
iOS. They were abysmal. Only 5 to 10 downloads a day. It's such a let
down. Such a beautiful game... and no one was downloading it.

Then the ray of hope. Courtney Stanton (@q0rt) tweeted about the
release of the game. This was a big deal given that it was the first
tweet about the game from someone outside of Michael's and my
development circles. Courtney also had large following on
Twitter.

This tweet also represented a window into the indie game world. I
started following this community more closely. Reports for downloads
of the game take a full day to get published in iTunes Connect. Seeing
this kind of tweet and not knowing the impact right away is nerve
wracking.

**Postmortem**

My approach to tweeting was unique. I spoke in the persona of the
game, it didn't come off as spammy. I searched for anyone that tweeted
about the webversion of ADR and replied with tweets such as:

>i consume a part of your soul every time you stoke the fire.

>send the snarling beasts, kill all the villagers

>she smiles...

I was lucky in this area primarily because there was already a "sales
funnel" for me to leverage. Check out the following chapter for some
tips: Finding Your Community.

**Day 165 - Nov 16, 2013: A Rude Awakening**

I woke up the next morning, awake, head throbbing, vision blurry. In a
sleepy stupor, I logged into iTunes Connect and saw the number of
downloads caused by Courtney's tweet. It spiked to 30. Thirty
downloads... a tweet sent to over 3,000 people... and it led to only
30 downloads.

**Postmortem**

Here is a screenshot of my sales to date. Not that great, but it's a
start.

![Day 165 Sales](manuscript/images/d165-graph.png)


**Day 167 - Nov 18, 2013: Additional Notable Interactions**

Using the @ADarkRoomiOS Twitter account, I interacted with Leigh
Alexander (@leighalexander), an editor at Gamasutra and Kotaku, about
a tweet she posted with regards to A Dark Room. Letting a number of
people in the conversation know about the existence of the iOS
version. There was no noticeable difference in downloads the next
day. A meager 5 downloads on the 19th. I'm glad I was able to have a
meaningful interaction with Leigh however.

**Postmortem**

It takes an immense amount of work creating this small connections. My
relationship with Leigh Alexander was one of these concerted efforts as
you'll see through this developer log. For more information about how
to approach editors/reviewers read the chapter: How To Contact
People That Can Help You

**Day 170 - Nov 22, 2013: Pocket Gamers writes an Entry on A Dark Room**

I added "search on Google for any mention of A Dark Room" to my
routine. I came across this:
[Take a risk on iOS adventure game A Dark Room and you might have a new addiction](http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPad/A+Dark+Room/news.asp?c=55477). This
review written by Chris Preistman (@CPriestman), is the first review
of A Dark Room iOS that I had come across. How freaking cool is that?
Unsolicited reviews are starting to come up. A spike to 30 downloads
happened that day.

**Postmortem**

When you see an unsolicited review. Be sure to reach
out to them in some way and let them know you noticed. Keep these
contacts warm. You have no idea when one of these small connections
could lead to something bigger.

## Day 171 - Nov 23, 2013: Touch Arcade ##

I received an email from a random person this day. The game was listed
in the Touch Arcade forums, and one of the members emailed me to get
some details about the game (what the game was about, how long the
game was, etc). I answered his questions immediately and was happy to
hear that he loved the game and wrote about his experience on the
Touch Arcade forums. Every week afterwards, I have emailed a promo
code to Touch Arcade for an official review. I have yet to hear back
from them.

**Postmortem**

The Touch Arcade forums are a great place to get some initial
visibility to your game. Developers are allowed a single forum thread
dedicated to their game. Be sure to keep a close eye on your forum
thread and post updates about your game here to continue to get visibility.

**Day 172 - Nov 24, 2013: The First One Star Review**

The game up to this point has had 245 downloads over an 18 day period
(that's 13 downloads a day). I had a few 5 star reviews from friends
in the development community. But I received my first 1 star
review:

>What was a simple and elegant game should not have been messed
>with. I regret spending $2 on such a mess. Not only is the UI
>counter-intuitive and clumsy, but the mobile designer took far too
>much creative license in altering the original statistics and
>proportions put in place by Michael Townsend, original
>designer. Additionally, there is a bug that results in permanent
>thieves with no way to deter them, making the game essentially
>unplayable.

What do I do? I played through the game hundreds of
times. Meticulously place every button, every interaction. There was
no bug in the thieves, I checked 10 times to make sure (just
impatience on the part of the player, and unlucky random number
generation). One bad review offsets 100 good ones. To this day I feel
the pains of this review. I see it as incredibly brutal. Empathy was
something I've learned through my time as an independent developer. I
understood how frustrating it is to pay for an app and get delivered
"shit". So I apologized on this support page. I have no idea if
blewis1234 will ever read anything on this page. But I hope at some
point, he'll re-rate the game.

**Postmortem**

One star reviews are inevitable. Try not to let it get to
you. Eventually you'll get used to a few bad reviews here and
there (at times many).

The good news is that every time you do a new release of your
game old reviews get archived. The review system is very important to
indie developers. Read the following chapter for deep insight on
techniques for getting your game reviewed: The Review System's Ins and Outs

**Day 174 - Nov 26, 2013: Game Back Story, an Apology, and a Post to Hacker News**

I updated the support page for A Dark Room to include some back
story. The name of the section is "A letter to the fans of A Dark
Room" (near the top). I posted this entry on Hacker News and
reddit.com/r/incremental_games to see if it would generate some
interest. Again, I ended up hoping against all hope that enough people
on Hacker News would remember the "Minimal Text Adventure" and show
some love. It didn't happen. The response I got on Reddit was a bit
better. I got quite a few kind words, which helped heal the wounds of
my first one star review. The next morning, because of the post to
Reddit, the game downloads spiked to 27 downloads.

**Postmortem**

Holiday weeks are absolutely wonderful. They are times when your game
(all apps for that matter) will get a natural spike. Thanksgiving,
Christmas, New Years, Spring Break, July 4th, Memorial Day.. pretty
much all holidays have this side effect. Do not run sales during these
time periods. There are your best days for a good amount of revenue.

The download spike I saw probably wasn't because of the post to Hacker
News or Reddit. It was probably because it was the day before Thanksgiving.

## Day 175 - Nov 27, 2013: Another Notable Tweet. A Stellar Video Review. ##

Cassandra Khaw (@casskhaw), an editor at USGamer, tweets about A Dark
Room on iOS. Again because of an interaction from @ADarkRoomiOS. I'm
getting more involved in the indie gamer community. Courtney, Leigh,
and Cassandra are all people that @ADarkRoomiOS (and by extension I)
follow. That day the downloads spiked to 45. The largest single day
download for A Dark Room iOS. The download trend didn't last. Every
time I think the download trend will hold, it doesn't.

I also came across a video review Chris Charlton (@reasonjp) did on
the
[iOS version of the game](http://kaijupop.com/2013/11/iospc-quick-vid-dark-room/). It
was an incredible review, and it truly made my day. These small wins
help me get through each disappointment in the number of downloads.

**Postmortem**

Again, Any time an editor/reviewer gives you an unsolicited
review. Immediately email them and thank them. Any time you do a
non-trivial update, send an email to them letting them know. Keep
these relationships warm how ever small of a reach that person has. As
a one-man/two man shop. Even a small conversion in sales is worth
it. Your main goal during this time period is to show these people
(everyone) that you a genuine person who loves the craft. That's the
edge you have against all the AAA companies out there. Because they
won't go through this effort.

With regards to Cassandra Khaw, she doesn't have an iPhone, but
believe me I'm going to reach out to here as soon as the Android
version is released.

**Day 188 - Dec 10, 2013: Blind Gamers Are Playing A Dark Room**

Blind gamers reached out to @ADarkRoomiOS: Orinks (a member of
AppleVis.com) and Aaron (a member of AudioGames.net). I was in
complete utter shock that blind people were trying to play A Dark
Room. I sent out a promise to them that I'd make the game fully
accessible. I fired up RubyMotion and started researching what it
would take to make A Dark Room fully playable via VoiceOver.

**Postmortem**

This is another small community I ended up being known in. Every
little bit helps. Ever word of mouth recommendation will get more
people playing your game. It's unlikely that you'll ever get a viral
smash hit. What you want to shoot for is a sustainable small number of
downloads. To this day, I'm 100% positive that AppleVis users
recommend my games to their friends and family. Simply because I took
the time to understand how they were playing the game, and enhanced
ADR to be playable via VoiceOver.

**Day 194 - Dec 16, 2013: Cara Ellison (@Carachan1)**

Cara Ellison, a writer for a number of online gaming website,
mentioned that she was considering A Dark Room for her 2013 Game of
the Year list. I reached out to her hoping she would have some kind
words to write about the iOS version. She said she'd give the game a
shot! I emailed her a promo code that day. Can't say this enough,
these moments are hard to put in words. It's a chance for all the hard
work Michael and I have put into the game to possibly pay off. For A
Dark Room to finally make it into the lime lite.

**Postmortem**

Leigh Alexander and Cara Ellison are my champions. They help me out
and recommend my games because I went above and beyond to make sure
they are in the know. Additionally I make a conscious effort to retweet
their articles and promotions on @ADarkRoomiOS's Twitter. You want to
empower those that empower you.

**Day 195 - Dec 17, 2013: Indie Mega Booth Does A Podcast on A Dark Room**

Another "search on Google everyday" result: Indie Mega Booth did a
full length podcast on A Dark Room. It's hard to believe 4 people can
talk so long about such a small game (it was awesome too). Just
wonderful to hear different interpretations of the story. They
mentioned that the iOS version of the game exists too. Yet again,
hoping against all odds that the mention of the game would spur more
downloads. I took the time to thank Indie Mega Booth for doing the
podcast and personally thanked Maddy Myers (@samusclone) on
Twitter.... such an awesome Twitter handle by the way.

**Postmortem**

At this point it finally sunk in that A Dark Room won't be an
overnight smash hit. After so many forms of media coverage, and A Dark
Rooms sales continue to be lukewarm.

Here's the graph so far:

![Sales Day 195](manuscript/images/d195-graph.png)


**Day 196 - Dec 18, 2013: Maddy Myers (@samusclone)**

Maddy Myers was part of the discussion on the Indie Mega Booth
podcast. She's an editor for Paste Magazine. Another important voice
in the gaming community. Every person I've interacted with thus far is
trying to be heard. Everyone in the gaming community (whether they are
an independent game developer or writer) is struggling in some
form. And all I can say is that I'll do what I can to make sure those
people who have supported A Dark Room, have my support in turn.

**Day 199 - Dec 22, 2013: Someone Stopped Playing Because of Slaves**

The first public comment about the slaves in the mobile version was
posted on Michael's blog. My biggest fear is the vengeful 1 star
review. I already had one... I didn't want another:

>I am hoping someone can help. I started to play through and had
>carted wood to the point the population becomes slaves. I then had
>thieves and it was taking so long to stop them that I thought you were
>supposed to stop carting wood before your population became slaves. So
>I reset. I left the cart alone even though it had a “!” Next to it. I
>now have the entire map uncovered, I have been to every location and
>have used the jewel. I have the space ship but I have no option to
>upgrade it even though I have 40 alien alloy. Is this a bug because I
>ignored the cart for so long or am I missing something. Very
>frustrating as I will NOT be replaying to get to this point.

Michael was able to get the email address for the person who left the
comment. And I emailed him immediately to tell him how to beat the
game. I also gave him a hint on how to unlock the alternate ending
where his villagers wouldn't become slaves. He was happy to receive
the email and I felt like I dodged a bullet.

**Postmortem**

Be responsive to players that you can reach. Email/tweet them if you can
find their info online. If someone emails you, reply to them fast,
even if it's to say "Hey, I got your email and will reply in full as
soon I get the chance." This shows that you care (which you genuinely should).

**Day 204 - Dec 27, 2013: A Dark Room, 2013 GOTY Lists, and Zoe Quinn**

I was holding my breath for this day. A number of online gaming
websites posted their 2013 Games of the Year. A Dark Room (the web and
mobile version) made three lists: Maddy Myers', Zoe Quinn's and Cara
Ellison's.

Additionally A Dark Room was the inspiration for a work of art by
Elizabeth Simins (@ElizSimins). She was listed as one of the top 10
works The Bygon Bureau.

This all happened in one day. I felt like I had won the
lottery. Surely, this is A Dark Room's moment. These three GOTY
entries probably reached 10's of thousands of gamers.

This was also the first time I heard about
[Depression Quest by Zoe Quinn](http://www.depressionquest.com/). I
know she was feeling the same thing I was. We were two indie game
developers, trying to create things that have meaning for us. And we
both made 2013 Game of the Year lists.

I played Depression Quest all the way through. It was an
_experience_... that's the best way to describe it. I'm glad there are
games coming out that connect emotionally with the player... that are
more than guns and eye candy. I reached out to Zoe and let her know
that the blind community are always in need for video games, and to
spend some time in making her game accessible.

I waited till the next day. I woke up in the morning and checked the
downloads... there were 54. It's the highest thus far... but that was
all the downloads that were generated... soul crushing I tell you.

**Postmortem**

In retrospect, the spike I got in downloads was probably because it
was during Christmas week. Here is a graph of sales:

![Sales Day 204](manuscript/images/d204-graph.png)

**Day 205 - Dec 28, 2013: Elizabeth Simins (@ElizSimins)**

After seeing her art work on Bygon Bureau, I reached out to Elizabeth
and asked if I could put her piece on A Dark Room's support page. She
said yes :-) Another bit of good news to keep my spirits up. Thank you
Elizabeth, I'm forever grateful that you allowed me to showcase your
work here (it's at the top of this page). Her work also led me to
discover [Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/elizsimins). I'm amazed at
how technology has given a means for artists to showcase their works
(and potentially make a living off of them). Removing the middle man
and making it easy for artists to promote their own works is a big
deal.

**Postmortem**

Patreon is another means of how I support those that support me. It's
such a simple token of support to give to things they care
about. There are creative minds out there that want to make a living
with what they enjoy doing. Contributing to their Patreon is a means
for you to do that.

## Day 209 - Jan 1, 2014: First Check From Apple ##

First check comes in. The grand totals for the month of November:

- Revenue: $478.27
- Downloads: 403
- Reviews: 5 five-star reviews, 1 one-star review
- RPG Rank: 567th at its low point, 27th at its height
- Overall Rank: 1,479th for two days (metrics below the 1500th
  placement aren't kept in AppAnnie)

**Postmortem**

Honestly, if your game can make more than $10 in the first month, it's a
massive success. It means that at least a few people are downloading
your game. Getting over $400 in the first month is absolutely
ridiculous given that the _life time_ median for most games in $400. I
can only attribute this first month's success to releasing during the
holiday season and the web version of A Dark Room. My third game, A
Noble Circle has a more realistic first month sales. If you can get
even that with your first game, consider it a success and
celebrate. Here is graph of A Noble Circle's first month's sales next
to A Dark Room's.

![ANC First Month Sales](manuscript/images/ANCfirstmonth.png)

**Day 212 - Jan 4, 2014: The Accessible Version of A Dark Room Is Released**

I worked through the holidays to get the accessible version of A Dark
Room completed. It spent about 5 days in the approval process and then
finally released on the 4th. I let Orinks and Aaron know about the
updates and they subsequently let their respective communities
know. The downloads spiked to about 40 downloads for the next two
days. I really didn't care about the downloads this time around. I
wanted to do the right thing. Given the accessibility updates and the
recent media coverage for A Dark Room, I changed the App Store description too:

>Awake. Head throbbing. Vision blurry.

>An unforgettable journey that starts small and slowly becomes much, much, more. Uncover the secrets of A Dark Room. Come light the fire.

>100% accessible and playable via VoiceOver.

>Awards and Recognition:

>Paste Magazine, Maddy Myers: Top 20 Indie Games of 2013

>Giant Bomb, Zoe Quinn: Top 10 Games of 2013

>Giant Bomb, Cara Eillison: Top 10 Games of 2013 (honorable mention)

**Postmortem**

For a deep dive on how to present your game in the App Store read the
chapter: Tips for Creating an App Page in the App Store

**Day 213 - Jan 5, 2014: Changes in Routine**

The iOS version of the game is solid. I still get a little antsy
releasing updates and brace for insta-crashes on my iPad Air. It
hasn't happened again though. With a little bit of breathing room, I
started working through Land of Lisp and started studying Clojure. I
also started doing screencasts on NodeJS development (my Coding Out
Loud screencasts). @ADarkRoomiOS's Twitter remained active. I kept
interacting with fans. It was a great way to relax and joke around
with the community.

I also started work on a "spiritual" sequel to A Dark Room. Lots of
HTML5 canvas work and AngularJS. Nodekick (the NodeJS game that Team
Us built for Node Knockout 2013) also got cleaned up.

I finally started to get used to the number of downloads for the
game. I accepted them for what they were. But I still meticulously
observed impact to the number and correlated them to what I did
online.

**Postmortem**

This would be one of the happiest times in my life. I _shipped_ a
freaking game. Don't down play the time after a solid release, relish
in these small wins. Celebrate. Be happy with what you've accomplished.

**Day 218 - Jan 10, 2014: Tweets Sent to 6k People**

A notable individual in the iOS community @ScottStevenson mentioned A
Dark Room. I replied with a few humorous tweets:

>"Just so you know. I consume a part of your soul every time you stoke the fire. #nomnomnom"

>"Just cause you followed me doesn't mean I'll give you anything back."

I got some retweets because of these interactions :-). Downloads
spiked to 40 for a couple of days. Thank you for the support
Scott.

**Postmortem**

Have fun with what you tweet. I could have tweeted: "Hi! There is now
a mobile version of A Dark Room. Check it out at: blah blah
blah". That wouldn't have gotten the retweets that this exchange got.

Your Twitter handle is a means for you to connect with fans and share
content with them that they would find interesting. Tweet about your
game, but also tweet about other games/shared interests. I made the
mistake early on and only tweeted about A Dark Room. Now, the tweets
that @ADarkRoomiOS sends out covers a broader list of interests
(mobile gaming, art, indie development, etc).

**Day 223 - Jan 15, 2014: Tweets Sent to 18k People**

A notable individual in the game community @RobertAshley interacted
with @ADarkRoomiOS too. I sent Robert to this page and told him about
how both Michael and I were the sole developers of the game. Robert
was kind enough to craft a tweet telling his followers about the web
and mobile version of the game. Downloads spiked again to 40 downloads
for a couple of days.

**Postmortem**

I think this was a genuine spike correlated to a tweet. It wasn't
within a holiday week and I wasn't being featured by Apple
(obviously). I would say each one thousand followers will get you a
download... so if someone with 10k followers tweeted about your game,
you can expect around ten downloads.

**Day 224 - Jan 16, 2014: Pocket Tactics and Owen Faraday**

Another wonderful interaction for @ADarkRoomiOS. This time, a random
follower mentioned @ADarkRoomiOS and @PocketTactics in the same
tweet... letting the iOS publication know about the game. I took this
opportunity to email Owen Faraday (editor of Pocket Tactics).

I asked if Pocket Tactics would like to do a review on A Dark
Room. Owen replied and I sent over a promo code (yay!).

On Feb 4th, Owen emailed with the word: "Amazing". I hope to see a
review show up soon on Pocket Tactics. I try to be diligent in
following up with Owen... without being annoying. It's hard to find a
good balance between the two. A review hasn't gone up yet... but after
another release of the game I'll be sure to follow up with Owen. I
hope he doesn't take offense to my persistence.

**Postmortem**

This is me pouncing again on an interaction. Stay vigilant with your
own interactions, they can pan out to be something more!

Again, for a deeper dive, read: How To Contact People That Can Help You

**Day 227 - Jan 19, 2014: Apple Vis Promo Code Give Away**

The blog post I wrote about accessibility received some buzz in the
blind community. The AppleVis editorial team reached out to me. They
wanted to run a promo code giveaway. I sent them 10 promo codes and
they did something really unique. Instead of just giving them away,
they asked individuals to go read the blog post I did on making the
game accessible to the blind, and about the making of the game. They
had to mention something from the write ups to get a promo code. It
was a great idea, and I saw a lot of nice things said about
the game.

Downloads spiked to 50 during the contest period. I'm burning through
my promo codes, but they are generating results.

**Postmortem**

I've included the blog entry under the chapter: Raising Awareness, The
Blind Use iPhones

Also by doing this promo code giveaway, I saw how to do promo codes the
right way and the wrong way. There is so much causality here:

- If I didn't eat that Jack in the Box the night before, I probably
  wouldn't have been pooping and reading Hacker News.

- If I didn't see the Hacker News link to A Dark Room while pooping, I
  probably wouldn't have ever seen it.

- If I wasn't on a sabbatical, I probably wouldn't have bothered with
  the idea of a port, knowing I didn't have any time outside of work.

- If I played the web version all the way through, I probably wouldn't
  have attempted to port the game over.

- If Michael didn't release it as open source, I probably wouldn't
  have contacted him.

- If RubyMotion wasn't around, I probably would still be trying to
  code the thing in ObjectiveC and XCode, breaking my computer in the
  process.

- If I didn't build a game using buttons and labels, it wouldn't have
  had some default voice over support.

- If I didn't add "text based journey" to the initial app description,
  a blind gamer would have never found the game.

- If I didn't have a Twitter handle for the game, the blind gamer
  wouldn't have been able to reach out to me as easily.

- If I didn't go back and fix ADR to be playable by voice over, I
  would have lost a connection with a close knit community.

- If I didn't write a blog entry about raising awareness for the
  blind, the AppleVis editorial team wouldn't have reached out.

- If the editorial team didn't reach out, I'd be giving promo codes
  away in a suboptimal way, making poor connections with the
  communities I want to be a part of.

**Day 234 - Jan 26, 2014: Promo Code Give Away on Touch Arcade**

I took Apple Vis' idea and gave away 20 promo codes across two
separate contests at Touch Arcade. The interactions I had with the
fans (old and new) was great. A lot kind words and genuine support.

The downloads for the last four days of January stayed at a steady 40.

**Postmortem**

Here is a graph of January. More related info on how to do promo code
give aways in: Finding Your Community

## Day 240 - Feb 1, 2014: Check #2 Comes in From Apple ##

The second check comes in. The grand totals for the month of December:

- Revenue: $943.00
- Downloads: 698
- Reviews: 3 five-star reviews
- RPG Rank: 201st at its low point, 33rd at its height
- Overall Rank: 1428th at its low point, 486th at its height (fell below the 1500 cut off for only 3 days)

**Postmortem**

Again, looking back. Almost _one thousand_ dollars. Think about
it. You're an indie developer, hopefully with some sort of full time
job while you're trying to make a passion into a career. Suddenly,
you've added _twelve thousand dollars_ a year to your bottom line.

If I realized this back then, I would have done the smart thing and
started working on the Android version (even if I'd have to write the
damn thing in Java... RubyMotion now supports cross platform
development, so I'm doing that now... in 2016... T_T).

As soon as I get the Android release out (hopefully before the year
2045), I'll add a chapter about revenue numbers. From what I've heard,
premium apps bring in a fraction of the revenue they bring in on iOS.

**Day 241 - Feb 2, 2014: Another Person Stopped Playing Because of Slaves**

So a bit of background about the iOS version and its ending game
sequence. The starship represents the end of the game. It is only
unlocked once you've progressed far enough in the storyline. If a
player avoids storyline progression, they are effectively stuck, and
can't complete the game. The villagers turning into slaves leaves
another person in this stuck state.

Here is a part of the email that was sent to me:

>Also I would like to mention that I liked this game until I found out
>I was getting screwed over.  I am playing it on an iPhone 4.  Just
>hoping you guys can fix this before a flood of unhappy folks come by
>and take your stars down a notch. And no I haven't rated your game
>because I am not the vengeful type.  Video games are hard to make and
>it seems you put a lot of effort into this. I am sending you
>screenshots of
>my game.

The player was kind enough to include screenshots of his current
game. I didn't need to look (but I did anyways). He stopped
progressing the storyline...
Here is what I wrote back:

>Every time you gather wood the storyline progresses toward the
>end. There is an alternate ending too. Some people are sad with how
>the storyline progresses. The alternative approach to playing the game
>(though much harder) leads to a happier ending. Let me know if you
>have any other questions. And I love hearing from fans. So don't
>hesitate to reach out. And thanks for the
>detailed screenshots :-)

He replied with:

>Mmm. I see now. Lol I was trying not to further my slave owner
>persona.  You know if you made a instruction manual and just mentioned
>a few things, I'm sure this app will be an even better hit. (Example I
>thought the carbine shot bullets not battery's, because there is a
>actual rifle named the carbine.  I think its ww2 era). I think anyone
>who played the older call of duties would make this mistake: Thanks
>for your help.  Say, if I could rack your brain, do I not need to
>build huts to get the new ending, or could I build huts but just not
>gather wood?

And a happy ending:

>Hey thanks!  I sure will.  I left a positive review in the App Store.
>I found this game on reddit.  I highly recommend creating a user
>account and posting something like "great iOS game, free downloads
>for the first 5 commenters". In the description write please leave
>review and comment for download.  Those people usually will help
>generate your sales.  I found a post about this game in r/gaming.
>Good luck and thank you for answering my emails.  I really thought
>the game was busted.
>Lol

I ended up putting a more assertive message about gathering wood to
progress the storyline within the game. In version 1.4, when you stoke
the fire (and there is a storyline element that needs to be dealt
with). You get a small message "need to gather wood, the forest
beckons". This will hopefully help guide
future gamers.

**Postmortem**

See what I mean with being responsive to emails? It helps. Also,
incorporate feedback and make your games better if you see a recurring pattern.

## Day 244 - Feb 5, 2014: Promo Code Give Away on Reddit ##

I'm burning through my promo codes at this point. The Apple Vis
approach to giving away promo codes leads to a much deeper connection
with the fans of the game. It's meaningful and I enjoy having all the
good conversations. I ran a couple of promo code giveaways on
Reddit.

Downloads spiked to 40 those days.

**Postmortem**

## Day 246 - Feb 7, 2014: A Hail Mary to Editors ##

I was down to my last 15 codes. I reached out to Cara Ellison on
Twitter about getting A Dark Room in front of people that may write
about it. Being the awesome person she is, she replied. I sent over 6
promo codes. The frustrating thing about promo codes is that I don't
know if they've been redeemed. I know Cara is extremely busy, and she
probably gets many, many emails from people trying to pitch her
games. I'm just glad that I have someone that can advocate for me. She
continues to be a ray of hope for A Dark Room. Unsolicited mentions of
the game and always responds to my emails. Thank you... thank you Cara.

**Postmortem**

At this point, I was out of ideas with regards to promotion. I spent
_a lot_ of time giving away promo codes. It is an immense amount of work
to do promo code giveaways correctly (Finding Your Community
chapter). I emailed Cara, Leigh, and Brandon emails like the
following:

>Subject:
>Need advice... I'm the indie dev that built A Dark Room for iOS

>Body:
>I built a game called A Dark Room, for iOS. It was inspired/ported
>from a web version built my Michael Townsend, another indie developer
>(with permission and royalty payments). The game has gained some
>popularity. Posting on forums, facilitating giveaways, and blogging
>about A Dark Room is exhausting... but, my efforts have gotten some
>results. The game is ranked in the top 10, on the iTunes App Store,
>under the RPG category (took 3 months to get there).
>
>I just don't know what to do now... I'm down to my last 10 promo
>codes and I've exhausted all of the connections I have through
>community, friends, and family. I've tried reaching out to a number
>of online review sites, but haven't received any responses.
>
>I found you on Twitter (Kotaku follows you) and then I saw that
>you're the chairman of the Indie Game Festival. So I decided to throw

>
>I'm sure you've heard this story many time before.... but I really do
>feel that A Dark Room is something amazing.
>It just needs some time in the limelight.
>
>Thanks for reading,
>Amir

**Day 250 - Feb 11, 2014: A Hail Mary to Brandon Boyer**

I'm getting more cautions at this point (I'm down to 9 codes). I'm
scouring Twitter for connections... people to reach out to... people
that may respond. @Kotaku follows only 41 people and is followed by
over three hundred thousand. It looks like the people Kotaku is
following is fairly exclusive.

There were two people on this list that I had hopes would respond:
Leigh Alexander (@leighalexander) and Brandon Boyer (@brandonnn). Both
had a large number of followers and (based on their profiles) are
receptive to indie developers. Brandon Boyer and Cara Ellison follow
each other. Leigh Alexander (someone I've interacted with before) and
Maddy Myers follow each other.... is this borderline stalking? ... XD

I end up emailing Brandon Boyer. I tried not to send him a wall of
text (it happened anyways). But Brandon replied after a few days
(yay!). I sent over a promo code. Now I just have to wait T_T.

**Day 251 - Feb 12, 2014: Appcessible Podcast**

Around this same time Jonathan Mosen reached out to me. He is another
individual from the blind community and came across the blog entry I
did on adding accessibility enhancements to A Dark Room. He wanted to
have me on a new podcast he was launching for the blind community. I
said yes (of course), [here is a link to the podcast](http://www.appcessible.net/talking-apps-podcast-episode-2-amir-rajan/).

**Postmortem**

This is a testament to being present in small communities. Out of no
where I received a request to be interviewed on a podcast. If you ever
get a request like this. Say yes and do it. Don't be picky. At this
stage it is always worth your time.

**Day 252 - Feb 13, 2014: Price Dropped on Game to $0.99 (50% off Sale)**

A Dark Room is now hovering near the top 10 under the RPG Category. I
didn't want the ranking to drop. I'm down to 6 promo codes, I have a
pending release, but haven't pushed it yet. So I dropped the price of
A Dark Room by 50% ($0.99).

I tweeted about it. A bunch of people tweeted about it. Pocket Tactics
wrote up a short piece on the game being half off. There was an
unsolicited Reddit post on the price drop. There was an unsolicited
post on Touch Arcade. I woke up the next day I look at the downloads.
They spiked to 351 in one day.

**Postmortem**

Here's another graph of sales at this time periods.

![Sales Day 252](manuscript/images/d252-graph.png)

## Day 253 - Feb 14, 2014: A Dark Room Makes it Into the Top 10 under the RPG Category ##

A Dark Room in now number 8 in the App Store under the RPG
category. Downloads have dropped to 100 after the initial spike from
the previous day. I didn't want it to lose steam. I wondered if I could set A Dark Room to free for two
days. Would it reset my app rank? The app dropped to number 11 the
next day. It was dropping again.... that evening I made the app
free... for two days.

**Postmortem**

Making the game free was a mistake. Don't change the price of your app
as it climbs, change the price of your app as it falls. I shouldn't
have made it free because ADR was climbing (not falling).

Also, can you believe that A Dark Room can barely stay in the top 25
in the RPG category these days? A viral smash hit with over 2.5
million downloads can't keep a consistent rank in a niche subcategory.

A deep dive into pricing changes is in the chapter: How to Price Your App.

**Day 254 - Feb 15, 2014: A Dark Room Is Free For Two Days**

A number of unsolicited posts went up again about the app being
free... over the weekend, A Dark Room got ~8,900 downloads and ~10 new
five-star reviews. But it lost it's rank entirely in the App
Store. The app went back to its $0.99 price. It took a couple of days,
but made it's way back to the ranking list. A Dark Room now hovers
around 30 in the RPG Rankings. To this day I still wonder if it was a
mistake to make the app free for two days.

**Postmortem**

In general, free games get _ten times_ as many downloads as paid
games.

**Day 260 - Feb 21, 2014: A Hail Mary to Leigh Alexander**

I reached out to Leigh via email... and let her know via Twitter that
I sent her an email :-D. After a few days, she replied back with some
interview questions for me and Michael! Hopefully a publication by
Leigh will bring some visibility to A Dark Room.

**Postmortem**

My first interaction with Leigh was back on day 167 (that's over 3
months ago). Some of these connections (especially with high profile
individuals) take a large amount of time to cultivate. If you aren't
going to be genuine with them, you'll get filed away under all the
other people that "pitch" their games.

**Day 263 - Feb 24, 2014: Reaching Out to RubyMotion**

I Talked to Karthik Hariharan about the viability of releasing A Dark
Room's source (with an e-book). Trying to think of additional ways to
generate income off of this IP. The game isn't making large amounts of
money in the App Store. Every time the game gets a "huge" spike in
downloads, it tapers off quickly. I keep thinking to myself "this
trend will hold, this trend will hold." But it hasn't done so
yet. Karthik also recommended that I reach out to the RubyMotion team
and that Laruent Sansoetti is a nice guy and may be able to offer some
advice.

I sent an email to the RubyMotion team telling them about the success
the game had so far. It was incredible getting a response back so
quickly from Laurent and then a tweet that reached a number of
developers.

**Postmortem**

Two years later and I'm finally writing the book... better late than
never I guess.

**Day 266 - Feb 27, 2013: Another Release of A Dark Room, The Review Me Button**

There is always a side effect to releasing a new version of the app to
the App Store. The first side effect: you lose all the reviews for the
current version of the App (only ratings for the current version of
the app show up in preview screens, the user can go and see the
reviews of the previous versions, but it's not immediately
obvious). The second side effect: you get more promo codes.

A Dark Room's current version has 56 five-star reviews, 1 one-star
review, and 1 four-star review. The app ranking was already shot to
hell (relative to where it was before), because of the two day price
change to free. So I figured this would be a good time to do an
update. I added the "you better go gather wood" notification to help
the player through the slavery period. I made more accessibility
enhancements to the game to make it a little bit easier for the blind
to navigate the Dusty Path. And I added a "review me" button to the
game. The app is currently in the App Store's review process. I'll
update this log as soon as I get the results/side effects from making
these changes.

**Postmortem**

Holy crap. Adding a review button to your game is important. Read the
chapter: The Review System's Ins and Outs.

**Day 270 - Mar 3, 2014: 12k Lines of RubyMotion**

A lot is still up in the air at this point. Version 1.4 is waiting for
release. I've permanently dropped the price of A Dark Room to $0.99 (I
don't know the long term effects of this). I'm hoping that Owen from
Pocket Tactics shows some love to A Dark Room on his website. I'm
hoping that Leigh publishes the interview questions. I'm hoping that
Brandon gets back to me about his thoughts on the game and with any
help he can provide. I'm hoping the RubyMotion team likes the slides
I've sent them and that I'll get some visibility with them too. I'm
hoping that my first presentation at a Ruby user group goes well. I'm
hoping the new review button generates more reviews. Lots of
hope... few answers at this point.

**Postmortem**

Pricing the app at $0.99 works well for A Dark Room. More info in the
chapter: How to Price Your App.

**Day 271 - Mar 4, 2014: The Review Button in A Dark Room**

The pending release to A Dark Room hit the App Store. As expected all
the reviews from the previous version get removed from the "current"
release. The app at this point is ranked 32 under the RPG
Category. With zero reviews for the current release. I knew this was a
risk going in, but with it, I got 100 more promo codes.

Outside of more accessibility enhancements, and a bit more storyline
elements; the most important part of this release was the review
button I added. The review button shows up after the player has beaten
the game. I decided to only show it at this point, because I know that
the player has experienced the story in its _entirety_ at least once.

That day I received 20 reviews. A small success to be celebrated. I'm
hoping to have an influx of reviews every few days given how long it
takes to beat the game... I'll probably be disappointed... but we'll see.

## Day 272 - Mar 5, 2014: Check Number 3 From Apple ##

The third check comes in. The grand totals for the month of January:

- Revenue: $1,320.00
- Downloads: 986
- Reviews: 11 five-star reviews, another one-star review
- RPG Rank: 154th at its low point, 25th at its height
- Overall Rank: 1469th at its low point, 432th at its height (stayed in the top 1500 Games for the entire month)

The one star review made me smile a little bit. You can't please everyone:

>its crap ★

>its a white screen those other ratings are rigged the game is junk

I knew that the first part of the game was slow to "reveal
itself". The web version takes 125 seconds for the builder to finally
wake up and open up the rest of the game. In the mobile version, this
time was dropped down to 45 seconds (specifically to avoid this kind
of review). I added a few "keep going" messages in the mobile version
that start revealing themselves 17 seconds into the game. Looks like
neither of these carrots kept Byrce68's attention long enough. It
sucks... but what can you do but smile and move on.

A message to the reviewer: I'm sorry that I wasn't able to keep your
attention, but none of the review are fake... all 20 of them (the
grand total at the time this review was written) are genuine,
through and through.

**Postmortem**

I use App Annie to keep an eye on rankings and download splits across
countries. iTunes graphs could learn a lot from App Annie.

**Day 273 - Mar 6, 2014: Leigh Alexander Publishes Her Interview on Gamasutra**

Leigh, thank you for this. Thank you for taking the time to interview
Michael and me. Thank you for skillfully writing about the journey
we've had so far.

Here is the write up [Leigh Alexander](http://leighalexander.net/) did
on A Dark Room:
[A Dark Room's unique journey from the web to iOS](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/212230/A_Dark_Rooms_unique_journey_from_the_web_to_iOS.php). It's
an amazing read. Gamasutra has 100k followers... it was tweeted by
their official Twitter handle. Additionally, the article was shared
~25 times on Twitter and got 15 likes on Facebook.

At this point, I have a better expectations of the impact these kind
of publications have on the number of downloads (it's small, but every
little bit helps keep me going). The downloads for the day spiked to
68 (a little over double my $0.99-price averages for the month). The
drop off is fairly quick for this kind of media coverage (given the
historical data I have now... I'll report back after a few days have
passed). Regardless, thank you Leigh Alexander. Thank you for this
small win I can celebrate.

**Day 274 - Mar 8, 2014: Two Days After the Gamasutra Publication**

Leigh's article stayed on Gamasutra's Top Articles for two days.

On March 6th, Leigh tweeted about it to 34k Twitter
followers. Gamasutra tweeted about it to their 100k
followers.

On March 7th, Leigh tweeted about the article a second time.

The game's download spiked to ~100 downloads for each day. Its rank
went from number 24 (in the RPG category), to number 16. All these
changes were in line with my expectations. I wanted to keep the
momentum going, so I decided to spend the next 4 days promoting the
game on Reddit, Twitter, and Touch Arcade.

**Day 278 - Mar 12, 2014: Four Days of Promotion**

I posted this write up on /r/IndieGaming and /r/GameDev. To share what
I've been through so far.. and yes, to help with visibility... two
birds with one stone, right? The posts gained popularity and I had a
number of good conversations, specifically about the viability of the
Android market (tl;dr; it doesn't look promising).

I did another promo code giveaway on Touch Arcade. But nobody (not a
single person), asked for a promo code. That was incredibly
surprising. I'm not sure if it was timing or if the people on Touch
Arcade just didn't care to get a copy. I let the thread die off. That
will be the last time I post on Touch Arcade.

The reception or Reddit was much better. I received a number of good
comments and support on /r/iOSGaming and /r/AppHookup. Thirty codes
were given away and the downloads for three days stayed at
around 80. Being active on Reddit and making sure to reply quickly to
conversations took up a couple of hours every day. A Dark Room's App
Store ranking (again, under the RPG section), continued to hover
around 15.

Good things came out of the the Reddit posts. I had a number of
incredibly candid posts about the game and the development logs. Many
people empathized and gave words of encouragement. Some didn't. Have I
mentioned how important tact and empathy are?

One notable conversation convinced me to try porting the game to
iPad. I decided to time box the port to iPad. Surprisingly, I wrapped
it up in a few days. I'm play testing the game now... on an iPhone 5,
iPhone 5s, iPad 3, iPad Air, and iPad 2... T_T.

Given that an iPad version was going to be released, I decided to give
away 50 more codes, but this time on Twitter (you lose any codes you
don't use within a release). I posted the codes and tweeted about
it. Cassandra Khaw (Editor at USGamers), Maddy Myers (Editor at Paste
Magazine), Laruent Sansoetti (Founder of HipByte and RubyMotion), and
Pocket Tactics (ie Owen Faraday) retweeted this promotion to their
followers (~13k followers combined). All the codes were claimed. Given
the downloads for that day, it didn't seem like they were all redeemed
however. There was no spike in sales either. My downloads (and
revenue) is flatlining now.

**Postmortem**

Here I end up trying to combine an editorial release, and promo code
giveaways to keep A Dark Room's rank high. Coincidentally, all this
is happening around Spring Break, which was also helping downloads.

**Day 279 - Mar 13, 2014: Back in the Top 10, iPad Release**

I woke up this morning. Awake, head throbbing, vision blurry
;-). Checked my app rank... A Dark Room made it into the top 10
RPGs... and finally cracked the top 200 in the overall Games
category. Back to testing the iPad/Universal version of the
game.

**Postmortem**

Build universal apps from the beginning. A little over 10% of my sales
comes from iPad downloads. Unfortunately, iPhone and iPad rankings are
completely independent. Also, you have no chance in hell getting
featured by Apple if you don't make apps that run on all of their
devices in their native resolutions. See the chapter: Pitching to Apple.

## Day 281 - Mar 15, 2014: A Dark Room is Ranked 6th Under RPGs ##

For the past two days, A Dark Room has gotten ~200 downloads. I
haven't done any recent marketing of the game to result in that kind
of spike. True, the game made it into the top 10 spot a couple of days
ago... but I didn't experience this kind of spike the last time it was
there.

The only thing I can think of was that the web version of the game got
1000+ upvotes in an AskReddit thread:
[Reddit, what is a fun webgame I can sink a lot of time into?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/20al3n/reddit_what_is_a_fun_webgame_i_can_sink_a_lot_of/cg1cxfy). Michael
mentioned that there was also an iOS version of the game within the
thread comments... I still don't think it could have such an impact
given that the
[comment was buried way way down in the post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/20al3n/reddit_what_is_a_fun_webgame_i_can_sink_a_lot_of/cg1s9ho). Maybe
it did... I have no idea.

Also. This dev blog was linked to in the following newsletters (I
received emails and tweets from a couple of readers):
[RubyMotion Dispatch](http://rubymotiondispatch.com/) and
[TapFame's](https://tapfame.com/) Newsletter. Again, I don't think
that such a spike could come from these distributions (I may
be wrong).

Regardless, it didn't last. A Dark Room's rank is back down to number
10 (/le sigh). The iPad update is in the App Store review process, and
will hopefully be released to the public next week (and hopefully
without that dreaded first day crash I experienced and still can't
explain). Perhaps the combined downloads from iPhone and iPad will
bring up the ranking again. From what I hear, getting into the top 5
in your category is a big deal... and from the looks of it you have to
be bringing in over 200 downloads for a solid week to break into that
spot number 5 (in the RPG category... no telling what you have to be
bringing in to get a top spot in another category).

All I can really do is wait. I'm out of promo codes. I have no control
over App Store ranking. Any amount of engagement I try to have on
Twitter won't bring in numbers like what happened in the last two
days. So I guess I'll geek out on something else for a while, and take
a break for the next few days :-).

**Day 284 - Mar 18, 2014: The Spike is Over. iPad Version Release**

The unexplained spike is over. Downloads are coming back down to
"normal" levels. This morning I received an email that the iPad
version of the game is ready for sale. Of course, with every new
release, I get a new set of promo codes, and all the reviews get
"archived" (wiped out frankly, frustrating). From March 4th to
today. A Dark Room received 85 reviews. One of them was a 4-star
review, one of them was a 1-star review, the rest were 5-stars. The
game was getting an average of 6 reviews a day.

With the release of the iPad version. A Dark Room will now be
searchable on all devices with default search filters. I'm also hoping
that the combined download numbers between iPhone and iPad will help
bring A Dark Room's ranking back up (which is currently hovering
around #17). The game did not crash when I installed it on my
iDevices. This was a huge relief for me, and possibly something I can
put behind me now... I'd be lying if I said I slept well these past
few nights.

**Day 285 - Mar 19, 2014: Mystery of the Week Long Spike Solved**

[Last week there was a spike in A Dark Room's download numbers that I couldn't explain](#top6). Kevin
Wade of OrgSync figured it out. It was because of Spring Break. A
bunch of people with time on their hands came to the App Store and
bought the game. A Dark Room's rank didn't increase in the App Store
with this large week long spike in downloads, because every game was
experiencing a similar spike.

This is also the first day after the iPad release. Downloads are back
to normal levels (a little over 100 a day). I didn't expect a big
spike because of the iPad release. The game still needs to make it
through the iPad ranking system (the iPhone rankings list is different
than the iPad rankings list). From historical data, it looks like A
Dark Room can make it into the top 20 in about a week. We'll see if my
prediction holds true.

Also, the first day after a release is always frustrating. When you
push out a new release, you don't lose your rank in the app store, but
you do lose all the reviews. So there sits A Dark Room, ranked #17 in
the App Store, zero reviews, one boring screenshot, who will buy that?
Thankfully, the trusty review button in the game pulled through
again. I got twelve 5-star, and one 4-star review yesterday.


**Postmortem**

Here is a graph of the time around spring break.

![Spring Break Sales](manuscript/images/d285-graph.png)

## Day 290 - Mar 24, 2014: What Happened When A Dark Room Was Free for Two Days ##

Spring Break (and the spike that came with it) was over... A Dark
Room's ranking was falling. Part of this fall was related to the new
release of the game (I think). This game has a huge risk every time a
new version releases: previous reviews of the game get archived, which
makes people, who've never experienced the game, hesitant in buying
it. I was lucky to get twelve 5-star reviews the first day of the v1.5
release... it didn't look like it was enough to convince people to buy
a game with only one screenshot, and a vague description. By the 19th,
A Dark Room had 18 five-star reviews, but its rank had fallen to 28th
in the RPG section.

At this point I decided that the game could benefit from a little bit
of publicity, so I made the app free for two
days. [I've done this once before](#top10), the difference this time
was A Dark Room was now equipped with a well placed review button. It
was worth the risk of losing my app rank if it meant I could get a
good surge of reviews.

For the 20th and 21st the app was free. I posted the announcement to
Touch Arcade, reddit/r/iOSGaming, reddit/r/AppHookup, and Twitter. As
expected, the game got a lot of love on all fronts. The "App discount"
syndications also published that the app went free.

The combined downloads for the next two days was 13,997. The last time
I did this, I received ~9,000 downloads. So it seems that these
numbers weren't a fluke at all. This is actually the amount of
downloads "top rated" free apps get on a daily basis.

The game (depending on how addicted the player gets), can be completed
in 3 hours, or up to 3 days of casual play. So now it was just a
matter of waiting to see if the review button was doing its job. I
waited two days before drawing any conclusions.

Here is the download history for time the app went free (with a couple
days before and after):

- Mar 18th: 161
- Mar 19th: 124
- Mar 20th: 4,654
- Mar 21st: 9,343
- Mar 22nd: 221
- Mar 23rd: 187

Again, I wasn't surprised that the downloads went back to their
regular numbers after the sale was over. But, during that time period,
A Dark Room received an additional 112 5-star reviews, one 1-star
review, and one 2-star review. It seems like players either "get" the
game or they don't... thankfully, the ratio is well in A Dark Room's
favor. Also, it seems that even with the well placed review button,
the conversion rate for reviews is about 1%... geez.

On the 18th, A Dark Room's iPhone and iPad RPG ranks were 28 and 71
respectively (and falling). The rankings were reset during the time
period when the app was free (a risk I was well aware of). Today, A
Dark Room's iPhone and iPad ranks are 16 and 40 respectively (and
rising... so far). I'd say the two day sale was a success.

**Postmortem**

If you have a review conversion rate above 3%. That's pretty freaking
amazing. Currently, A Noble Circle is my only app that is commanding
3%+ conversion rate. I give some in depth information in review
techniques in: The Review System's Ins and Outs.

**Hold on to Your Butts**

This concludes the first part of my developer logs (before A Dark
Room) went viral across 5 countries. Hope your ready for the next part
of this ride.

# A Dark Room Goes Viral

I gave up at this point. Or more accurately I felt I had done as much
as humanly possible with regards marketing.

**Day 301 - Mar 31, 2014: Attack of the Minecraft Clones, and a New Hope in the United Kingdom**

For the past two weeks, a certain "anomaly" has existed in A Dark
Room's small part of the App Store. There are two games that have
managed to take top spots in the RPG category: Skyblock - Survival
Game Mission Flying Island (which I'll call Skyblock1) and Skyblock -
Mini Survival Game in Block Sky Worlds (which I'll call
Skyblock2). Skyblock1 and Skyblock2 hold the _first_ and _tenth_ spot
in the RPG category. The average rating for both games are two stars.

I'm not sure what is going on here. I am well accustomed to the "I
don't get it this is dumb" one-star review (I see that as a failure on
my part by the way...). And here are two apps, that are in the top 10,
and their reviews are mostly poor. Are the people that are reviewing
this game, simply "not getting it"? Where are the reviews of people
that enjoy the game?

As I've mentioned before, getting a top spot in rankings takes a
consecutively high number of downloads, day after day. These games
have been holding a top spot now for what looks like _two
weeks_. These games are definitely bringing in a high number of
downloads, but very few good reviews.

Is the Minecraft "franchise" simply that popular? Here is a list of
Minecraft based games that are high ranking right now:

- Skyblock - Survival Game Mission Flying Island (\#1 spot, 2-star
  average)
- Hunt Games - Mine Mini Survival Game with Blocks (#9 spot, 2-star
  average)
- Skyblock - Mini Survival Game in Block Sky World (\#10 spot, 2-star
  average)
- Minecraft Skin Studio - Official Skins Creator for Minecraft (\#12
  spot, 4.5-star average)
- Adventure With Companions - 3D Online Multiplayer Block Building
  Sandbox With Creative (\#17 spot, 4-star average)
- Minecraft Explorer Pro (\#18 spot, 3.5-star average)
- World Explorer - Made for MineCraft (\#19 spot, 2.5-star average)

A Dark Room is currently ranked 20, with 220 reviews, average 5-star
rating... in the United States.

A few days ago, I saw a small spike in downloads. I didn't think too
much of it. Yesterday, there was a 300% increase in A Dark Room's
downloads. This got my attention. I tried to make sense of why this
spike existed. App Annie, a site I use to track this stuff, showed a
disproportionate number of downloads in the United Kingdom App
Store. After looking at rankings, I saw that A Dark Room was recently
promoted to the \#1 spot in the UK App Store. Not \#1 RPG, not \#1 Game,
**A Dark Room is currently the \#1 app _overall_.**

I don't have any details (yet) about what impacted this, or how many
downloads this will translate to in the long run. One thing I've
learned so far, you have to have tempered expectations. I've reached
out to Cara Ellison and Leigh Alexander (editors in the UK) to see if
they have any idea about what's going on. I'm still trying to connect
the dots... trying to understand how this happened. I'll add another
entry as soon as I do.

**Postmortem**

This climb to the top spot sill puzzles me to this day. Here is a
graph of sales in the UK vs the US around this time period. I'll have
a chapter specifically for dissecting what happened: Analyzing Spikes.

![UK vs US Day 301](manuscript/images/d301-graph.png)

## Day 302 - Apr 1, 2014: Day Two, at the Number One Spot, in the UK App Store ##

A Dark Room has managed to stay number 1 in the UK App Store for March
30th and 31st (so far). Here are my observations:

Downloads have dropped 10% from D-day (March 30th). This was
surprising given that when the app was free, the
downloads were higher on day two.

The gains in the UK App Store don't seem to be influencing US
sales. It may be too early to say this, but that's what I've seen so
far.

Another observation (and I think this is unique to the game), is there
is now a higher number of 1-star reviews. For the past two days, A
Dark Room has received 59 5-star reviews and 38 1-star reviews.

If you've played the game, you know that the first part of the game
has a slow reveal, and opens up "phase 2" only after you've bought the
compass. I'm trying to put myself in the shoes of those that are in
the UK. Here is a game... and it's the top app in the App Store. There
is only one screen shot, a vague description and many of the review
say the same thing:

>**A-MAZING** - I don't write reviews. I find those "Rate this Game"
>popups extremely annoying. This game doesn't have those. Instead it
>waits until right at the end, after it has blown your mind, to ask
>for a rating. And for the first time ever, I felt obliged.

>**One of a kind! Superb** - "I never write reviews," or "I hardly
>write reviews!" That's how all of the others have begun and if that
>doesn't draw you in then you shouldn't be on the App Store. This
>unique game has kept me entertained for hours on end...

>**Wow!** - Well where to begin, I read the reviews and not knowing
>anything about the game I took a punt on it and I'm glad I did! What
>a brilliant game! ...

>**;)** - A brilliant game very addictive and interesting concept. I
>would highly recommend it

>**Fantastic** - Really atmospheric, very minimalist: an RPG, a
>survivor sim, a text adventure. Absolutely brilliant and shows you
>don't need graphics to make a really absorbing atmospheric game.

I decide to give the game a shot. I _pay_ money for it. Pressing the
buy button is a very powerful gesture. It doesn't matter if the app I
am buying is $1 or $100. The act of buying something in the App Store
has become an exchange of trust, more so than an exchange of
money. When I hit the buy button, I am putting trust in the developer,
trust in the App Store to curate apps, trust in the reviews that they
are accurate and true.

So here I am, a random person browsing the App Store, I may not even
be a gamer, I may not even _like_ RPG's. And here's this app, it's in
the _top spot_, and I decide to give a token of _trust_. I open up the
app, and am presented with a black screen, and a single progress
bar. I press the "light fire" button, and the screen changes color. I
play for 5 seconds?, 10 seconds?, 5 minutes? The "game" does
effectively nothing, a few pieces of text comes onto the screen, the
progress bar updates, some new buttons show up, leading to more
progress bars, the screen changes colors... that's it?

I want immediate gratification for my _trust_, and I'm not getting
that. My trust is short lived, since its being placed in the hands of
complete strangers. I'm enraged, I'm so incredibly angry right now
that I gave my trust to the developer, Apple, the reviewers,
strangers, humanity... and I feel _betrayed_. So I leave a review to
show my dissatisfaction:

>**Fake reviews** - It's literally the most repetitive boring
>game. Was interested for about half an hour thinking it would get
>better but after a whole and giving it a chance, it just turns out
>it's pointless tapping

>**Bit of a scam** - I bought this a week ago thinking the reviews
>looked positive. Now having played the game and read through further
>reviews I feel scammed. Poorly hidden "I don't usually write" fake
>reviews are littered everywhere.

>**SCAM!!!** - Worst game ever!!! Don't buy it! Reviews are fake!!!

>**Awful! The worst!** - his is the most awful game I have ever played
>! It costs £0.69 which I would like back and it has fake reviews
>written about it by it's own company! DO NOT EVER BUY THIS "game".

>**Con Artist of 2014 award goes to...** - Well I don't usually write
>reviews either, but after reading the hundreds of reviews below I can
>only come to the conclusion that they were paid to do them....

When the game was in a quiet spot in the App Store, a lot of the
downloads came from people recommending it word of mouth. You really
couldn't find the game unless you specifically looked in the RPG
section and scrolled down a couple of pages. When a real person, a
friend, a fellow gamer, an esteemed editor recommends something to
you... you give their recommendation more trust, and as a by product,
you give A Dark Room more of your time.

The trust in the App Store, the trust in developers who develop
products for the App Store is forever waning. And I can see the
exhaustion and frustration that people feel (I feel it myself when I'm
browsing for apps). And right now, that frustration is being directed
to A Dark Room.

No, adding another screen shot or more details about the game won't
help. One, because the game isn't visually appealing, and two, because
I'm a stranger... I could be a scam artist that is putting up fake
screen shots (I'm not of course). Most importantly, if I added any
kind of hint to what was in the game, it would take away from the
discovery that the player experiences. And I won't do that.

At this point, all I can do is wait. It takes anywhere from 3 hours to
3 days to beat the game and get a "review me" button presented to
you. I have to put _my_ trust in the player, and hope that they take
the time to review the game, and show that A Dark Room really is
something brilliant and unique.

As a consolation, I've got some chuckles out of the reviews,
specifically this one:

>**Avoid** - To summarize, I would actually rather be in a dark room,
>with nothing else is in it, until my untimely death before playing
>this app again. The endless time that is spent tapping could be spent
>building a time machine that would take you back to the time you
>pressed 'install' just so you can slap yourself in the face. Take
>your 70p and go purchase a lettuce and tap that, it would be more
>productive... And at the end you have a lettuce.

**Postmortem**

After having over 25,000 reviews. I can make one conclusion about the UK
App Store versus ever other country. People in the UK are mean. At
least when it comes to games that are slow boil minimalist text
base RPG's. I have received the most visceral responses, lowest 5 star
ratings, and highest 1 star ratings from there.

Here is a list of "love/hate" ratings. Below is the number of 5 star
ratings, 1 star ratings, and percentage of the total ratings (4, 3,
and 2 star ratings excluded). These are rating breakdowns for each
country A Dark Room has hit the \#1 spot in.

- United States: 24,710 (93%) to 1,079 (4%)
- Singapore: 252 (90%) to 6 (2%)
- Australia: 1,913 (87%) to 103 (5%)
- Germany: 876 (86%) to 42 (4%)
- Canada: 2,356 (86%) to 136 (5%)
- New Zealand: 148 (83%) to 9 (5%)
- United Kingdom: 2,181 (78%) to 279 (10%)

Out of curiosity. I also looked at Monument Valley's US rating vs UK:

- United States: 17,594 (77%) to 1,036 (5%)
- United Kingdom: 3,622 (76%) to (4%)

And Geometry Dash:

- United States: 185,618 (89%) to 1,798 (1%)
- United Kingdom: 20,198 (89%) to 173 (1%)

And Alto's Adventure:

- United States: 4,919 (83%) to 116 (2%)
- United Kingdom: 1,197 (80%) to 33 (2%)

And Lifeline:

- United States: 15,765 (81%) to 644 (3%)
- United Kingdom: 1,784 (74%) to 133 (5%)

Yep... the United Kingdom doesn't like A Dark Room for some
reason. One tiny deviation would be that of Lifeline, which is another
"text based" game.

## Day 303 - Apr 2, 2014: Day Three, at the Number One Spot, in the UK App Store ##

A Dark Room has been in the top spot in the UK App Store for 3 days
now. Downloads have fallen 56% from day two, but A Dark Room's rank
still remains \#1. From what I've observed so far, the rankings are
heavily determined by the number of downloads you get (not the
reviews). Given that the downloads are falling, this rank position may
not last much longer.

I don't have enough data yet, but it seems like the rankings in the UK
App Store _are_ influencing the US App Store. With no noticeable spike
in US downloads, A Dark Room has jumped to the #9 spot in the RPG
Category and the 146th spot in the Games category. That is both
exciting and _terrifying_. From what I've read, the US App Store
market share is 5 times the size of the UK.

The reviews have a definite pattern. You either _love_ the game or
_hate_ it. Here are the review number for yesterday:

- 5-star: 44
- 4-star: 3
- 3-star: 0
- 2-star: 1
- 1-star: 26

The reactions in the reviews continue to be visceral. Here are a couple:

>**Amazingly bad!** - I lasted 30 seconds. I don't know what's worse,
>being charged more than a penny for this rubbish or reading the
>obviously faked reviews after purchasing or finding the developers
>epic long long long faked diary in making this 'game' that a 5 year
>old could put together. he also actually seems to believe that no one
>can review the 'game' without having completed it! Will be getting
>onto apple for a refund. Yes i can do that too!

>**Fraudsters!!** - This game is awful. All the reviews are fake. The
>people behind this have broken the law as this is clearly fraudulent
>activity designed to get you to part with your money for false
>promises. Absolute disgrace. Pure theft. Pure criminality.

One person from the UK actually "called @ADarkRoomiOS out" on
Twitter. Against my better judgement, I decided to engage with
her. I'm glad I did. Conversation follows:

>her - @ADarkRoomiOS what a con! Waste of money, I wish I could warn
>others the reviews are fake.

>me - I'm truly sorry you feel conned. More info about the game here,
>please take a moment to read if you can:
>http://amirrajan.net/a-dark-room/

>me - did you get a chance to read the development log I had put up
>with regards to A Dark Room and my sabbatical?

>her - I'm sure the game is great; maybe it's just not for me. But all
>the best to you, and I hope your success grows.

>me - I appreciate that, but perhaps put yourself in my shoes. Any
>ideas how I can communicate that it isn't a con?

>her - hey look, don't pay attention to the likes of me. Keep creating
>and keep making the cash, I would do the same!

>me - thank you... you're a part of A Dark Room's history now. In a
>good way. :-)

>her - haha thanks! Maybe I should reinstall the app and uninstall my
>ignorance

**Postmortem**

Approach every negative outcry with a calm and collected mind. Read
what ever was posted, go work out and let off that negative energy,
let it simmer, sleep on it, cool off, and then reply. Try to come at
these negative comments without emotion.

Here is another example of me trying my best to reply to someone who's
played one of my games. This one is for prequel to ADR called The
Ensign. I got the email after I added poison to the game:

Them:

>I'm done with playing Ensign.  Your update made a punishingly hard
>game that rewards patience, repetition, and strategy, into a crippled
>mess that will kill an experienced player within 60 seconds,
>randomly.  I shouldn't, after countless hours of gameplay sunk into
>the game, be capable of being killed less than 60 seconds into the
>game.  And due to the nature of mobile app updates, I don't even have
>the option of going back to the version of the game I ENJOYED
>playing, enjoyed losing even, because I could see where I'D made a
>mistake, and learned from it.  From everything I've read or heard you
>say, I'm sure you're smiling about this message, if you're even
>bothering to read this far.  And I'm sure I'm not the first to send
>you a message like this.  And I'm sure this next part won't matter,
>but I mean it sincerely:  You've lost a customer for any future game
>you create, and you've made me regret giving you money for a game I
>used to enjoy playing.

Me:

>First of all I'm glad you reached out to me. Believe me I am. The
>recent updates to The Ensign primarily revolved around balancing the
>punch level. They were too overpowered and took away from the
>strategy with regards to refusing food. Before I released the updated
>version, I made sure that I could consistently beat the game with
>refusing food. I sunk countless hours into play testing the game to
>make sure it was balanced and far.

>I'm not smiling about bring this kind of frustration. The general
>theme of The Ensign is to be sadistically soul crushing at times. But
>it should definitely rewards persistence and experience.  Would you
>mind telling me where you felt the deaths were unfair? I plan to work
>on it more this weekend. Maybe I can get you beta access to the
>update and you can give me some early feedback?

>Building games is my dream job. I wish I could do it full time as
>opposed to nights and weekends. The last thing I want is to lose you
>as a customer.

Them:

>When I say the first 60 seconds, I mean that pretty literally.  On
>multiple occasions, on entering the first house, I encountered a
>hostile and died, despite punching as fast as possible.  In general,
>it's so much easier now to die not because of lack of preparedness,
>but just a long string of bad dice rolls in combat.  I kept missing,
>they kept hitting, and because I had refused food, I had no means of
>healing.

>And fighting the guards of the tannery is now nearly impossible.
>Fighting ANY enemy with more than 5 health with only level 1 fists
>has a strong chance of being a death sentence, especially if food is
>low.  A weapon helps...but now a knife often goes from 100 to 0 in a

>leveling up (the punching, mainly), so I stuck with it.  I've given
>this new version lots of my time, with far, FAR less result, with the
>exception of a few extra red texts haranguing me.

Me:

>I hear ya man. When I was playing it again with refusing food, I was
>furious at myself with decreasing accuracy and remove punch powers
>(and adding poison).

>The way I beat my own monstrosity of a game was make a B-line for the

>rarely puts a baddy in there). Any house further than 2 spaces is a
>complete dice roll. After getting a knife, head immediately back for

>the accuracy of the baddies are at 70%. I was thinking about adding

>I played The Ensign all morning and these are the changes I decided
>to make. What do you think?

>- Accuracy for both player and baddies set to 100%.
>- Precision artifact removed (cause you don't need it any more).
>- Evasion artifact was still kept as a way to decrease the enemies precision.
>- Moved melee artifact out of the occultist to the wandering master.
>- Decreased encounter rate from 20% down to 10% for the houses nearest the swamp.
>- Lowered the DPS for tannery men from 6 to 5.
>- Doubled the durability of knifes.
>- Moved wandering master further out (harder to find).

Them:

## Day 305 - Apr 4, 2014: The Fall From the \#1 Spot in the UK App Store. Here Are the Final Numbers ##

After five days in the top spot of the UK App Store, A
Dark Room finally dropped to the #2 spot. Observations:

- You either love A Dark Room or hate it.
- Once you make it to the top 5 of your category, things begin to pick
  up.
- There doesn't seem to be any correlation between the UK and US App
  Stores.
- The US App Store is _definitely_ larger than the UK App Store.

Here are the final numbers leading up to the \#1 spot in the UK:

- 3/22 -   40 downloads, rank 403
- 3/23 -   58 downloads, rank 333
- 3/24 -   38 downloads, rank 337
- 3/25 -   36 downloads, rank 277
- 3/26 -   47 downloads, rank 211
- 3/27 -  108 downloads, rank 100
- 3/28 -  296 downloads, rank 29
- 3/29 - 1088 downloads, rank 5
- 3/30 - 5959 downloads, rank 1
- 3/31 - 5037 downloads, rank 1
- 4/01 - 2812 downloads, rank 1
- 4/02 - 2654 downloads, rank 1
- 4/03 - 2195 downloads, rank 1

Here are the US numbers:

- 3/22 - 125 downloads, rank 636
- 3/23 - 109 downloads, rank 573
- 3/24 -  83 downloads, rank 643
- 3/25 -  88 downloads, rank 605
- 3/26 - 106 downloads, rank 604
- 3/27 -  82 downloads, rank 774
- 3/28 - 100 downloads, rank 637
- 3/29 - 117 downloads, rank 719
- 3/30 - 140 downloads, rank 623
- 3/31 - 103 downloads, rank 560
- 4/01 - 127 downloads, rank 468
- 4/02 - 181 downloads, rank 314
- 4/03 - 176 downloads, rank 242

During the 5 days at the top spot, users of the UK App Store gave A
Dark Room the following ratings:

- 5 stars: 195
- 4 stars: 17
- 3 stars: 2
- 2 stars: 6
- 1 stars: 94

As for the reviews, I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't affected
emotionally by people claiming that A Dark Room was a scam and I was a
con artist. There were three individuals on Twitter that actually
called out A Dark Room publicly. I addressed each tweet individually,
exercising an extreme amount of empathy. Each person ended up
retracting their statement about A Dark Room and apologizing (one even
said that they'd give A Dark Room another shot). If anything, this was
preparation for what _will_ come if I make it to a top spot in the US
App Store.

**Postmortem**

Having your baby called ugly really sucks. Having a barrage of 1 star
reviews come at you really sucks. You build something you put your
heart and soul into, and then without even giving what you created an
honest shot, they put their 1 star review and delete it calling you a
scam artist. For those that find themselves in this situation, all I
can really say is that you get used to it, and it won't hurt/annoy you
anymore. It just takes a while to get to that point.

**Day 310 -Apr 9, 2014: \#1 RPG, \#5 Game, \#10 App, in the US**

Here we are. Ten days after A Dark Room made it to the \#1 spot in the
UK. This morning, A Dark Room is ranked \#1 in the RPG category, #5 in
the Games category, and is the \#10 app, _overall_. I still have no
idea what's happening. I don't know definitively whether the buzz in
the United Kingdom somehow caused the same kind of viral outbreak in
the United States.

But (so far) the trends are holding. As soon as A Dark Room hit the \#1
spot in the RPG category, a snowball effect occurred (similar to what
I saw in the UK). If you look at the rank progression in the UK,
you'll notice that A Dark Room hit the \#1 spot overall, three days
after it became \#1 in the RPG category. A Dark Room hit the \#1 RPG
spot, in the US, late on April 6th... which makes day number 3,
today. I doubt it'll jump 10 spots in one day, but it's worth noting
how similar the trends are.

Outside of impacts associated with being \#1 in the UK. The following
_may_ have given A Dark Room more steam in the United States.

As soon as A Dark Room hit the \#1 spot in the UK I reposted what I
wrote here on /r/gamedev:
[What happens when your iOS game goes viral and becomes the \#1 app in the UK App Store](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/220quk/what_happens_when_your_ios_game_goes_viral_and/). The
post received 200 up votes, and there were many good conversations to
be had.

Out of sheer luck. A Reddit user asked the following question on
/r/askreddit, which Michael ended up responding to:
[Has anyone here ever built a $20 or $40 desktop application, or $0.99 to $5 mobile app, and made real money from it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/227qln/has_anyone_here_ever_built_a_20_or_40_desktop/cgk7rhp). The
question received 1159 upvotes, and Michael's response was the top
comment.

Around this same time, a review site, that I reached out to a couple
weeks ago, gave A Dark Room 3 stars (the review said mostly good
things about the game, so put your torches and pitchforks down):
[148Apps - A Dark Room Review](http://www.148apps.com/reviews/dark-room-review/)

That's all that's happened as far as I know. A Dark Room has dropped
to #5 in the UK. Downloads are still dropping and haven't leveled
off. Positive reviews out score negative reviews 3 to 1. Given what
I've seen in the UK, if A Dark Room does indeed hit the top spot, it
won't stay there for long.

*Postmortem*

Here are graphs of the US climb to this point:

![US climb graph](manuscript/images/d310-graph.png)


## Day 316 - Apr 15, 2014: \#1 in the App Store ##

A Dark Room iOS finally clawed its way to the \#1 spot. It happened on
April 13, 2014. It took seven, very long days to make it there from
the \#1 RPG spot. I was in shock when it passed Mine Craft in the
rankings. I literally gasped out loud when it passed Monument
Valley. I laughed sinisterly when it took down RBI Baseball 14 (an
officially licensed game of the MLB). This marks the third day at the
\#1 spot.

The trends in the United Kingdom should give an indication as to what
will happen in the US. Here are some observations and predictions:

- The US App Store market is a little over 3x the size of the UK (not 5x).
- iPad sales have been insignificant relative to iPhone.
- Not a single major gaming website has done a piece about A Dark Room (yet).
- The reviews in the US have been overall positive! (a ratio of 9 to 1 as opposed to UK's 3 to 1)
- A Dark Room will fall out of the \#1 US spot _very_ soon.
- It'll see a 20% drop in downloads, day over day, until it levels out.
- It'll take ~25 days for this "leveling" to occur.

In the UK, A Dark Room is currently ranked \#12. It _seems_ that the
game has finally leveled out (or at least the fall has slowed down
considerably). A Dark Room is averaging 400 downloads a day over
there.

I'll of course continue to post new observations as soon as I have
more data. Also, there is going to be another _unique_ update to the
game that may cause another viral out break (probably not, but I can
hope).

tl;dr; I won't be able to retire on the revenue A Dark Room is
generating (not by a _long_ shot), but it'll definitely extend my
sabbatical.

*Postmortem*

Here's the graph to the \#1 spot:

![US #1 spot](manuscript/images/d316-graph.png)

**Day 330 - Apr 29, 2014: Waiting for the New Normal**

A Dark Room has been \#1 in the App Store for 17 days now. During that
17 day period, the game has gotten 241,494 downloads. Every trend and
projection I've made against what I saw in the UK has been broken:

1. In the UK, it took 3 days to make it to the \#1 spot overall, from
   the \#1 RPG spot. In the US, this took 7 _long_ days.

2. In the UK, A Dark Room was taken out of the \#1 spot by an Apple
   Editor's Choice pick (Monument Valley). In the US, A Dark Room has
   survived _two_ Editor's Choice picks (Hitman GO and Leo's
   Fortune).

3. In the UK, the reviews had a ratio of 3 positive reviews for every
   1 negative. The negative reviews called the game a scam and claimed
   that all the other reviews were bought by me. In the US, the
   reviews have a ratio of 9 positive reviews for every 1 negative
   review. There are some that state the game is a scam, but most of
   the critical reviews in the US are valid (they found the game
   boring, over hyped, incomplete, etc).

4. In the UK, A Dark Room stayed at the \#1 spot for 6 days. I thought
   to myself "Okay, it took twice as long to get to \#1 in the US, I
   can expect to stay at \#1 twice as long." A Dark Room is going on to
   the 18th day now.

5. In the UK, A Dark Room's downloads dropped 20% day over day after
   the initial days at \#1. In the US, the downloads are _level_ and
   spiked _again_ on 4/20 and 4/27. None of this makes sense.

Every day has been a bit stressful. Which app will take me out of the top spot?

1. Goat Rampage: A game "inspired" by the viral hit Goat
   Simulator. How the heck is A Dark Room going to survive a popular
   meme? For four days, I kept a close eye on this game, waiting for
   it to swap places with me and take the \#1 spot. It didn't.

2. Hitman GO: When this was featured by Apple, I thought I was
   done. Here is a game built by a powerhouse, Square Enix. What
   chance does A Dark Room have against that kind of shop? A Dark Room
   survived.

3. The Amazing Spider 2: This game was wire to wire with Hitman GO,
   climbing up the ranks. Two threats at the same time. A Dark Room
   survived.

4. Heads Up!: On April 22nd, Ellen DeGeneres plays Heads Up! on her
   talk show. The game shoots up to #2. How the hell will A Dark Room
   survive a game that has _celebrity sponsorship_? It did.

5. Wayward Souls: A rouge-like RPG with a cult following. So
   incredibly awesome that it's available on iOS. "If Wayward Souls
   takes out ADR, I'm okay with that. That will be an honorable
   defeat," I said to myself. But it fell down the ranks too.

6. Leo's Fortune: Apple stops promoting Hitman GO and picks Leo's
   Fortune. Another beautiful game that showcases the "beauty of
   iOS". I watch it climb day after day. And then it drops too.

7. Blek: This game, just yesterday, jumped _13_ spots in one day to
   claim #2. It's built by an indie dev too. I know he is going
   through the same thing I've been going through. A mix of hope and
   stress. He is eyeing how quickly he gets new reviews, he probably
   wakes up in the middle of the night to see if he's over taken A
   Dark Room... just like I wake up to see if I'm still \#1.

Now, all I can do is survive till Tuesday. Tuesday, is a magical
day. It's the day where the media takes notice of the top apps in the
App Store (whether they want to acknowledge A Dark Room or not). This
however doesn't cause any kind of spike in downloads. But it's nice
seeing what the internet has to say about A Dark Room every time it
survives another week. By far, the best unsolicited article was
published by
[The Knox Student](http://www.theknoxstudent.com/news/2014/04/17/procrastination-station-mobile-gaming-for-hipsters/).

All I can do now is wait for the "new normal". That moment where I get
used to this unfamiliar terrain, and I can finally get a decent
night's sleep.

This is the best way I can describe what I'm feeling right now: I've
bought a lottery ticket, and the lottery commission has revealed 5 of
the 6 numbers. And so far, I've gotten those 5 numbers right. I know
I've got at least the winnings for those 5 numbers in the bag. But now
I'm waiting for the 6th number... that jackpot number that changes
your life forever. The lottery commission hasn't revealed the 6th
number yet, they haven't even told me when they'll show the 6th
number. So I'm stuck in this weird limbo, where others see success and
all I can do is temper expectations, be "responsible", and move
forward as if that 6th number will be wrong... still number 1, just
checked.

*Postmortem*

A few things worth covering through this time period (and some advice
I should follow myself now that I'm writing it down):

- A Dark Room's downloads spiked a second time on 4/20 because it was
  Easter (two holidays if you observe the Smoking Holiday
  also). Holidays are a wonderful time for sales, so don't go dropping
  your prices or making your games free during these time periods.

- Touch Arcade gave coverage to A Dark Room. Apple started giving A Dark
  Room minor features. These are important because only a relative
  handful of games ever make it to this point. Surviving the App Store
  comes down to these two entities noticing you. See chapter: How
  Getting Featured Impacts Sales.

- Fourteen days of barely sleeping is not good for your health. Also,
  the App Store refreshes app rankings every 3 to 4 hours. Stop
  sleeping with your phone at your bedside. Get an alarm clock to wake
  you up and leave your phone far far away. See chapter: Dealing With
  Stress.

- Exercise is extremely important. It's one of the few things that
  left me tired enough to get some sleep. And I don't mean taking
  leisure walks. For me it was going to the brink of passing out (not
  saying you should do that, but find something that lets you take you
  mind off of X completely).

- Celebrate milestones and successes (both large and small). As I'm
  writing this, A Dark Room is \#2 overall in Australia and I'm not
  losing any sleep over it (nor am I celebrating because I'm "used" to
  this now).

- Wayward Souls and Leo's Fortune are awesome games. You should
  download them (out of childish spite, I haven't played Blek to this
  day).

- I don't know how Heads Up! is still ranked so highly. Warner
  Brothers as released a number of variants (all endorsed by Ellen),
  yet all of them have essentially tanked.

**Day 336 - May 6, 2014: The Fall from the US Top Spot**

It finally happened. On April 30th, around 5pm, A Dark Room lost the
\#1 spot in the US App Store to Blek. I knew ADR would lose the spot at
some point, but its still hard to describe what I felt when that
happened.

I refresh the App Store list on my iPhone and see the two mostly-black
icons still holding the number one and number two spot (A Dark Room
and Blek). It takes a split second to realize that the \#1 spot isn't A
Dark Room anymore. I feel defeated and relieved. The climax of this
story has passed. I am finally into the falling action and
dénouement.

During this time period, A Dark Room received quite a bit of news
coverage:

- Not
  [one](http://www.cultofmac.com/277035/dark-room-iphone-top-paid-game/),
  but
  [two](http://www.cultofmac.com/277118/dark-room-lights-app-store-big-heart-open-world/)
  write ups on The Cult of Mac, an online publication that reaches
  _millions_.
- A write up on
  [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/01/a-dark-room-iphone-game_n_5241335.html),
  which reaches _millions_ (even Ellen DeGeneres follows them on
  Twitter).
- A write up on Medium by
  [Barrett Sheridan](https://medium.com/@bsheridan), formerly a tech
  editor at Bloomberg Businessweek.
- An interview with DFW CBS 11... I was on local TV! But I don't have
  cable/bunny ears, so I couldn't watch it #sadpanda.
- An article/interview for the Dallas Morning News.
- That plus a few small independent blogs wrote about the game.

All this, and A Dark Room _still_ fell from \#1. It's, in fact,
struggling to keep the #6 spot now. US downloads have dropped 80% from
the weeks before. On the bright side, being out of the top spot gave
me the window to push out a crucial release of the game. The reviews
will reset, but it's (now) worth the risk.

In other news, on Apr 29th, ADR hit the \#1 spot in both Australia and
Singapore.

- In Singapore, ADR got 161 downloads at the top spot and fell soon after.
- It took only a day to get there after becoming \#1 under RPGs.
- In Australia, ADR got 1300 downloads, but _rose_ for another 3
  days, before starting its plummet.
- It took 7 days to get to the top after being \#1 under RPGs.
Reviews have been mostly positive in both countries.

![Us, Singapore and Australia 4/29](manuscript/images/d336-graph.png)

With regards to reviews, I still wonder why the app was received so
negatively in the UK. Here are my two working theories:

- Smaller markets are more susceptible to scam apps. It's much easier
  for an app to quickly move to a high spot with a hundred or so paid
  for reviews.
- Reviews are ordered based on number of stars and length. The top
  reviews _set the tone_ for the rest of the reviews. I think we are
  subconsciously influenced by the "top" reviews. If a long,
  critical/angry 1-star review is posted (and the velocity for new
  reviews is low), then that "top" negative review will influence
  every person that tries out your app. In the case of the UK, a
  couple of reviews were long and extremely negative, calling the game
  a scam. And they stayed at the "top of the list" for a long, long
  time.

The stress I've continued to feel is this lack of consistency. No
market is the same, download numbers are a constant roller coaster
(the game spiked moderately in the UK again yesterday), human behavior
isn't predictable, and media impact is hard to correlate. All in all
the App Store feels impossible to rationalize.

With regards to the new release. There is a "secret" that I added,
which is only available to those that have beaten the game. We'll see
what kind of impact it has to downloads and review velocity. I expect
review conversion rates to _significantly_ increase for those that
have beaten the game. Regardless... I feel that A Dark Room's time at
\#1 has passed, and I won't see that spot again.

**Postmortem**

The volatility of the App Store is why you can't rely on just one
title. A Dark Room has been able to hold its own for a while, but now
my other two games bring in 30 - 40% of my overall revenue. See
chapter: Lifetime Revenue

If you start seeing a large spike in your games (like going viral in a
small country), this is the best time to reach out to Apple and Touch
Arcade. They will take notice and help you keep that snowball going.

After this roller coaster, the lack of sleep, the dreaming of never
having to work again, and the 1-star reviews/hateful emails, I decided
to start looking for a job again.

**Day 356 - May 26, 2014: A Dark Room's Second Wind**

Twenty four days ago, A Dark Room fell from the \#1 spot. This fall
gave me the opportunity to release an updated version of the
game. With the release, ADR lost its average rating, and all of its
glowing reviews got archived.

The new release was an attempt to deepen the connection the game had
with the current fan base. If you've beaten the game at least once, a
section to the game would be unlocked where you can listen to
developer commentary given by me and Michael.

I had started working on this commentary back in
March. Around this time it didn't look like ADR was
gaining any ground... I was entertaining the idea of making ADR free,
and providing the developer commentary as an In-App Purchase. I was
nearing finished with the release of the IAP, but ADR suddenly
went viral in the UK. Given the risk involved with
resetting reviews, I decided to hold off on publishing the new
version. When ADR made it to the \#1 spot in the US,
Michael and I decided to remove the IAP and release the commentary as
a free update to the game.

ADR fell. I published that same day. By the time the new release hit
the App Store (a week later), ADR's rank had fallen to the #7 spot
over all. The next day, the game fell another spot. But then, two days
after the release (9 days after falling from \#1)... ADR stopped
falling. It gained one rank day after day. By May 23th (22 days after
the fall), A Dark Room made it back to the \#1 spot.

So many variables were at play during this 22 day rise back to the
top. I've done my best to summarize what all occurred. Any conclusions
I draw are pretty speculative given that time and time again my
predictions are proven wrong.

_Variable 1: App price drops_

Blek, the \#1 game in the App Store made a smart move. About 4 days
into their \#1 streak, they dropped the price for their game to
$0.99. I did something similar back when I was
struggling to stay relevant in the RPG category. Imagine what kind of
increase Blek saw when they dropped the price of their game by
_66%_. From what I've observed, a drop in price leads to an inversely
proportional increase in downloads (with the added benefit of being
able to say "I'm running a sale"). This little maneuver solidified
Blek's \#1 spot.... until A Dark Room took it back.

_Variable 2: Review velocity and quality_

Here is ADR's rating breakdown along with "quality" metrics (average
number of words).

From Apr 8th to May 6th (version 1.5 without developer commentary),
ADR received the following review breakdown:

- 5 stars: 3,710 ~82%
- 4 stars: 301 ~6%
- 3 stars: 107 ~2%
- 2 stars: 81 ~2%
- 1 stars: 345 ~8%
- Average Rank (not to be confused with rating): 2.44
- Total reviews: 4,544
- Reviews per day: ~162
- Conversion Rate: 1.47%
- Average Review Length: 31 words

From May 7th to May 25th (version 1.6, with developer commentary), ADR
received the following review breakdown:

- 5 stars: 1,613 ~87%
- 4 stars: 72 ~4%
- 3 stars: 24 ~1%
- 2 stars: 33 ~1%
- 1 stars: 95 ~5%
- Average Rank (not to be confused with rating): 3.60
- Total reviews: 1,837
- Average reviews per day: ~102
- Conversion Rate: 1.61%
- Average Review Length: 38 words

It _does_ seem that the developer commentary helped give a little more
reason to give a 5 star review (but not by much). Outside of that, it
doesn't look like the new release significantly impacted ADR's rise.

_Variable 3: Number of downloads before hitting \#1_

It took a much longer time to get back to \#1 from similar "low"
ranks. It took fewer average downloads, but a longer period of time.

Number of downloads from the \#15 spot to the \#1 spot on version 1.5:

- 4/08: 2,153
- 4/09: 4,310
- 4/10: 6,152
- 4/11: 7,669 (placed #2, day before \#1)
- Average: 5,071
- Total: 20,284

Number of downloads from the #7 spot to the \#1 spot on version 1.6:

- 5/07: 2,820
- 5/08: 2,531
- 5/09: 3,074
- 5/10: 3,528
- 5/11: 4,135
- 5/12: 4,878
- 5/13: 6,659
- 5/14: 6,164
- 5/15: 6,271
- 5/16: 6,300
- 5/17: 6,052
- 5/18: 5,690 (placed #2 in the US, \#1 in Canada!)
- 5/19: 4,313
- 5/20: 4,845
- 5/21: 5,462 (day before \#1 in the US)
- Average: 4,848
- Total: 72,722

![Second wind and comparison to UK,Canada, Singapore and Australia](manuscript/images/d356-graph.png)

_Variable 4: Relative performance of others in the App Store_

Heads Up! briefly knocked Blek out of its \#1 spot (for a few hours),
but soon fell back to #2 (and then #3). On the 14th, Ellen DeGeneres
[posted a Heads Up! session with Emily Blunt](http://www.ellentv.com/videos/0-vrobj813/),
which may have contributed to its very brief bump. But that's how
Heads Up! rolls (see what I did there). It's an quality game with
celebrity sponsorship. And because of this, it's held a top 10 spot
_since May of 2013_.

Minecraft is Minecraft. This game is an "expensive" premium app with a
review velocity of _300+ a day_. I think it's found a happy balance
between rank and price. It's held a top 10 spot _since July of 2013_.

Plague Inc. has had a volatile existence. Its rank has fluctuated in
the top 20 _since May of 2012_. That's _two years_ of "top spot" daily
revenue.

Blek (can I call it my arch nemesis?) did an awesome job with timing
its sale, making it really hard to take back \#1. They _did_ eventually
change the price back to $2.99, which may have contributed to their
fall.

I have no idea what kind of price elasticity exists with regards to
high ranking apps. My assumption is that Blek is measuring this
elasticity themselves, or felt that net revenue at a lower rank/higher
price was better than net revenue at a higher rank/lower price.

Michael and I have wondered what would happen if we increased the
price of ADR, but have decided against it. Other games have precedence
on other platforms, are celebrity backed, or have been around a long
time. They show everything they have to offer, invest a lot in
marketing, and ask for a fair price up front. ADR has no official
media coverage, says nothing in the description, looks absolutely
ridiculous with its single screen shot, and asks for $0.99.

To summarize my summary:

- The v1.6 update didn't seem to have a noticeable effect on ADR's rise back to the top.
- There's an incredibly complex symbiotic relationship with other ranked apps.
- It's too soon to tell how ADR will perform in the long run.

**Postmortem**

As an indie game developer, cultivating a strong connection with those
that play your game is the best weapon you have against AAA
companies. The developer commentary I added strengthened that connection
and was one of the best moves I could have made. The Ensign and A
Noble Circle both have developer commentary. All three of my games
have a very high rating/high rating conversion rate. See chapter: The
Review System's Ins and Outs.

A Dark Room is a bit unique with regards to pricing (primarily because
it's so secretive about what the game is about). After looking at
other games like Blek and You Must Build a Boat, set your price to
$0.99 or $2.99. It seems that the price elasticity for $1.99 and $2.99
is about the same. Above $2.99 and that's when downloads drop
significantly.

**Day 381 - Jun 20, 2014: Taxes, Negative Reviews, Clones, and Open Source**

Alright, this one has been on my mind for a while. It's going to be
difficult to exercise empathy and be tactful within this post, but
I'll try. Let's get started.

_Taxes_

There's no escaping it, you have to pay taxes. ADR is subject to
income taxes. Period. No way around it. And given that App Store
revenue is considered self employment income, I get hit with an
additional 15% self employment tax, all of which has to be paid
quarterly. Paying estimated taxes in itself has its challenges given
the volatility of the App Store revenue. I don't want to get penalized
for underpaying, but at the same time, I don't what to give the
government an interest free loan either. June 15th, I wrote a check to
the IRS for $60,000. Based on projections of this depreciating asset,
I'll have to pay $30,000 quarterly. Hopefully the annual amortization
is accurate, and I end up owing a penalty free amount at the end of
the year.

So... after Apple's 30% take, royalties of 50% (no complaints here,
ADR iOS wouldn't exist if it weren't for Michael's permission), and
then a 45% hit in income taxes, I net 19.5 _cents_ on every
download. YTD downloads are ~635,000. No way in hell we'll get that
many downloads H2.

The terrifying part is that very few apps see even a fraction of this
success. So think twice before selling almost everything you own,
taking a year long learning sabbatical, and spending months porting a
minimal text based RPG to mobile... you may be better off building
apps after hours, or charging high dollar hourly rates to build an app
for some company.

_Negative Reviews_

Just as death and taxes are inevitable, so are negative reviews for A
Dark Room. I've been keeping a collection of
[heart warming positive reviews here](http://adarkroomios.com/reviews.html),
I hope you find them a great read. Let's enumerate the categories of
negative reviews.

The _Honest, Critical_ Review:

A number of reviews in the App Store fall into this category. They are
fair, well written, and simply didn't like what they bought. They
spent the time to share their thoughts and warn others.

>Not That Brilliant... (1 star): The novelty of this game wears down
>almost immediately after the first time around. The whole point of
>this I suppose is to make us introspective and question particular
>things in the universe. But as much as this game would like you to
>think, you're not really in control. The fate of the game has pretty
>much been decided and no matter what you do there are pre ordained
>responses that characters like 'the builder' will have no matter
>what. I found that incredibly annoying.I guess it got the message
>through to me, but I don't think of this game as very deep or
>thought-provoking. Give me Angry Birds any day and I'll ponder the
>higher meaning of destroying smiling green pigs while actually
>believing that my 1 dollar wasn't for naught.

The _It's a Scam_ Review:

I've talked about this before (and exercised large amount of empathy
when doing so), so let me be a little mean. Here's the review:

>Absolute scam!! Manipulated reviews!! (1 star):	It's a text based
>game. That's ALL you get. Nothing like any review said how fancy and
>interesting the game play is. I suspect all the reviews are done by
>the developer himself using auto generated review. It is done by
>developer by purchasing the game himself through hundreds, if not
>thousands iTunes account, then give good rating over a period of
>time.

And here's my response:

>Dear reviewer, you're an idiot.

The _I didn't get my money's worth_ Review:

I live in a world where we carry $600 super computers in our
pockets. We pay $15 for a two hour movie leaving satisfied, but paying
$0.99 for _only_ two hours of entertainment is considered a rip off.

>Not worth the .99 (1 star): I beat the game in 2 hours, and the game
>doesn't do anything to reward you for winning. I like the game but
>it's missing depth and replay value.

The _Ransom_ Review:

The App Store is actually a great way to get feedback on what's
broken. Pay attention to these "ransom" reviews. Because they'll give
you insight on what needs to be fixed.

>Magnificent (3 stars): Good game but the thieves take too long	Great
>game, i read your post about the making of the game and I am very
>sorry about making a 3 star review, but I spent more than 30 minutes
>with the thieves. I hope they'll go away soon, and the second they do
>ill rate it 5 stars. Thank you.

In this case though, I've already nerfed the thieves once, I'm not
doing it again.

The _Just Plain Mean_ Review:

Welp. They are just mean. Really mean. No other way to describe them.

>What is this? (2 stars) - Before I bought this I was unsure so I
>looked at the reviews. They were all glowing which intrigued me, so I
>downloaded.. Played for about 2 minutes then deleted it! Absolute
>load of rubbish, it's sort of like sims but with no graphics, like a

>first!

The _Leg Sweeper_ Review:

These reviews are simply there to bring you down. They want so badly
to explain the success of something they don't see as
"good". Belittling me, and others that have reviewed the game. These
are by far the most poisonous reviews. They bring me down and bring
down every other person who played and enjoyed the game.

>Garbage (1 star) - It's so nice to have this hive-mind community full
>of hipsters and morons raving about the worst goddamn games. Same
>thing happened with Angry Birds and Flappy Birds. You people are

I have no words for this person. Here's another:

>lives of blind people. Then they ask that you leave a review. Well,
>here's my review. Don't be fooled...

Here's my reply, again with a lack of empathy:

>How do you explain v1.5's 18 day streak at \#1? There wasn't any
>developer commentary in that one asking people to review
>ADR. Lawyered.

Here are the YTD numbers for 1 star reviews:

- United Kingdom: 191 of 1081 (18%)
- Canada: 68 of 767 (9%)
- Singapore: 4 of 46 (9%)
- Australia: 51 of 605 (8%)
- United States: 557 of 8730 (6%)

Lesson learned. Don't release text based adventures to the UK. I've
become numb to the words "rubbish", "bore", "scam/fake reviews", and
"dreadful" because of the UK.

_Clones and the Spirit of Open Source_

Michael released ADR under MPL. And what do some do? They take what
Michael built, wrap it in a browser control. They add advertisements
at the bottom of the screen, and deploy it to the App Stores/Google
Play as a free app. We've requested take downs for some of these
apps. And they simply give us the finger by using the MPL as their
defence.

It's frustrating, not that these apps exist, _but that these bottom
feeding apps are being created by developers who went onto GitHub and
cloned Michael's repo._ Michael said it best:

>I open-sourced A Dark Room exactly because I wanted people to be able
>to learn from it, and use it as a starting point for their own
>projects. That said, I'll admit to being a little disheartened that
>people are taking advantage of the brand that I've built to make a
>quick buck.

What these devs are doing is legal (outside of potential common law
trademark violations, but that'll be a whole-nother entry). Morally,
however, this goes against the grain of what open source is all
about. And that, is truly heart breaking.

**Postmortem**

It took Michael a little over a year to get an international trademark
for A Dark Room. During this time period, I spent a lot of time
battling clones using the Common Law Trademark as weapon.

Don't worry about trademarking your stuff until you've hit the big
time. Oh, and don't make your IP open source. Both Michael and I have
learned our lesson. The Ensign nor A Noble Circle are open
source. Michael's Gridland is also not open source.

It's infuriating that there are small time game developers out there
that take advantage of their own like this. But that's the nature of
the situation, and giving that all my future works will be proprietary
with copyrights owned soley by the creators.

## Day 402 - Aug 11, 2014: One Million Downloads in Seven Days ##

I've slowly watched the rank and downloads of A Dark Room fall day
over day. I thought there was a point where ADR's daily downloads
would level out, but there really wasn't. By the end of July, A Dark
Room was bringing in approximately 200 downloads a day. This is a
level I haven't seen since February where I did a 50% off sale. Isn't
that insane? A game that took the \#1 spot for 18 days straight was
now averaging downloads as if it were a game that just hit the App
Store. I guess this shows again that you can't count on a consistent
income from the App Store.

One thing was different however with these downloads. I was slowly
increasing the price of ADR to $3.99. At this point, it was safe to
assume that the game wasn't being "sold" by its overall game ranking
(which was barely in the top 100), and most downloads (if not all)
were coming from the fact that ADR was one of the top 5 RPG's. Here
are some download numbers at each price point. You'll notice that
there is _very little_ inelasticity in price (even for top ranking
apps).

- 7/14 - 756 downloads at 0.99 with category rank of 1
- 7/15 - 713 downloads at 0.99 with category rank of 1
- 7/16 - 648 downloads at 0.99 with category rank of 2
- 7/17 - 503 downloads at 1.99 with category rank of 2
- 7/18 - 339 downloads at 1.99 with category rank of 2
- 7/19 - 373 downloads at 1.99 with category rank of 2
- 7/20 - 432 downloads at 1.99 with category rank of 2
- 7/21 - 321 downloads at 1.99 with category rank of 2
- 7/22 - 246 downloads at 1.99 with category rank of 2
- 7/23 - 241 downloads at 1.99 with category rank of 3
- 7/24 - 230 downloads at 1.99 with category rank of 3
- 7/25 - 221 downloads at 1.99 with category rank of 3
- 7/26 - 195 downloads at 2.99 with category rank of 3
- 7/27 - 275 downloads at 2.99 with category rank of 4
- 7/28 - 237 downloads at 2.99 with category rank of 4
- 7/29 - 142 downloads at 3.99 with category rank of 4
- 7/30 - 145 downloads at 3.99 with category rank of 6

Revenue stayed about level, my rank dropped. This is in line with what
I've seen in the past (download count is king). So here I am sitting
at the #6 spot, exactly where I was five months ago before the game
ever went viral. Looking through my dev logs, I decided to do exactly
what I did back then: I made the game free to bring in "new blood".

Then, the impossible happened. On day one of being free, ADR received
36,831 downloads. Day two, A Dark Room sky rocketed to 111,209
downloads. In 48 hours, ADR went from being ranked as the 329th app
overall to the 32th. I decided to see how far ADR could go. On the
third day ADR had passed Candy Crush, Clash of Clans, Kim Kardashian,
and pretty much everything else. By the 7th day, A Dark Room was the
\#3 app in the App Store overall, out ranked by the Facebook Messaging
App (which everyone was forced to download), and Crazy Taxi (which was
being promoted by Apple at the time). Here are the download numbers
for those 7 days:

- 8/1: 36,831 (went free mid day)
- 8/2: 111,209
- 8/3: 203,882
- 8/4: 223,006
- 8/5: 213,379
- 8/6: 187,014
- 8/7: 43,307 (flipped back to paid mid day)
- Total: 1,018,628
- Total Reviews: Jumped from 7,800 to 11,914 (4,114 reviews)

As far as media coverage, Pocket Tactics, 148Apps, and Touch Arcade
wrote about this sale. Extra Credits was kind enough to tweet about it
too (they rock). It's hard to say how much of an impact they really
had to the download numbers given that media coverage in the past
really hasn't helped ADR (but I may be wrong).

*Postmortem*

It took A Dark Room a little over 400 days to conquer the paid and
free App Stores. The rest of the chapters in this book take deeper
dives through out this _exhausting_ journey. Here are some graphs
showing different points during this roller coaster ride.

# Build Games for Mobile

**tl;dr;**

_These list of tips are for the one-man/two-man/three-man shops. If you
have a team of people, then some of these things may not be applicable
to you. I'm also assuming you're making mobile games (not cross platform)._

_I've got 3 games in the App Store, all of which at one point
or another has made it into the top paid app in their categories.
A Dark Room has been a #1 app overall. The Ensign has made it into the
top #10 list overall. A Noble Circle has been the #1 Music game and #3 RPG.
After 2+ years of doing this, the most important thing is to stay
true to who you are. As an indie game dev, you are "selling" yourself
as opposed to just a game. So find your style and stay consistent
with that. You'll find an audience (even if it's a small one)
who will continue to support you and buy your games._

**Buy Other Indie Games/IAP**

Commit to spending some amount of money per month on indie games and IAP. If an indie
game gets featured by Apple, buy it and see what they are doing right. You have to
understand the market. If you've never bought a game or IAP, how do you know if you
yourself are doing a good job? So, buy games, learn from them, support your fellow
indie developers for fuck's sake.

**Build Games That Can Be Played in Short Sessions**

You want to build "snack-sized" experiences for mobile. I play my mobile
games on the can (you do it too, don't deny it), during commercial breaks
while watching TV, waiting in lines, etc. So build
games that can be picked up and put down quickly. This doesn't mean you
can't build games with immersive story lines (I've done this "successfully"
three times). It also doesn't mean you can't build "sit down" games like
Transistor (they are just less likely to succeed given the nature of this
platform).

**Build Games for Mobile**

You don't have a controller. You have a touch device. Build games that
are optimized for simple input/touch. You can still make games that are really
smooth/fluid. Take a look at Leo's Fortune, Piloteer, Wayward Sword, Downwell,
and Sword of Xolan. The controls for these games are tight and satisfying.

You may also want to consider games that are played in portrait mode,
one handed. It's one of the reasons why Flappy Bird did well (imho). Other good
vertical games are Hoplite, Threes, You Must Build a Boat, 0h h1, and 0h n0.

**Build Games You Can Finish Coding in a Short Period of Time**

You have to build games that can be completed in two to three months (part time).
I use the term "completed" loosely however. There is nothing stopping you from
updating your games, but something "complete" should be released within two to three months.
I've seen too many stories about how a couple of guys have spent a year
plus on a game and still haven't released anything to the App Store. Don't do this.

On this same thread. I'd say have an alpha version of your game ready by week
six. Submit this version to the App Store as a soft launch. You don't need to
market the release of your game, but at least get through the App Approval Process
and get something in the store that you can get early feedback on. If you don't
feel it's worth charging for, go ahead and release it for free with a description of
"Early access pricing, get it now while it's free!!". Don't put any notes when
submitting to the App Store that the game is incomplete (you may get
rejected for saying that).

I can't stress this "first release" enough. You need to get something out there.
Honestly, you probably won't get any downloads... but life of the app in the
App Store does influence rank, so why not get a head start on this?

**Release Every Six Weeks Until You're "Done"**

Assuming you took the advice above, you'll still be working on your game while
it's in the store. You'll want to schedule a nice six week rhythm. This accomplishes
a few things.

You have a sense of urgency for your next release. You know that whatever new game
mechanic you want to implement has to be done within this time frame. This forces you
to chop things up and really think about what's important and what isn't. For A Noble Circle,
I take one six week period to optimize and polish, and another six week period to add new
story elements and content.

Releasing often keeps your audience coming back to see what's new. Every release of
A Noble Circle gets people excited to see what I've added. They will replay old levels
to see if I changed anything, and they are more inclined to leave reviews with constructive
feedback. I've had people leave negative reviews, and then come back a few releases later and
say "Things are shaping up nicely, good work!"

Releasing often resets the reviews (reviews will get archived with every new release). So you
spend less time worrying about a critical review and more time on fixing what they complained
about.

Releasing often shows Apple that you keep your apps updated ([this will help when it comes
time to pitch your app for getting featured](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/3to145/getting_featured_by_apple_by_the_guy_that_built/)). There may come a time where you
will get considered for an App Store Feature. Apple loves apps that are constantly updated
with new/compelling content. So having a good update history will definitely help you out.
You generally don't want to release more often than six weeks for this same reason (you're just
overloading the editorial and review teams at this point... so don't do it unless you have a
nasty game breaking bug).

**Report Inflammatory Reviews**

Reviews that are just plain negative (to you or other people) should be reported.
Long negative rants aren't great to see on your review page, and frankly Apple
doesn't want them showing up either.

Here are a few examples of reviews I got for A Dark Room that are eligible for
removal (I didn't remove them simply because they are hilarious):

>Garbage (1 star):
>It’s so nice to have this hive-mind community full of hipsters
>and morons raving about the worst goddamn games. Same thing happened
>with Angry Birds and Flappy Birds. You people are disgusting. Horrible
>unwashed masses of brainless consumers. Hey morons, take a step back
>and really consider the piece of crap you rated 5 stars.
>No, really, just take a moment.

And another one:

>What is this? (2 stars):
>Before I bought this I was unsure so I looked at the reviews.
>They were all glowing which intrigued me, so I downloaded..
>Played for about 2 minutes then deleted it! Absolute load of rubbish,
>it's sort of like sims but with no graphics, like a weird text version.
>Just utter nonsense how it has so many good reviews! If it was between watching
>a blind man trying dismantle a computer and playing this
>came I know which one I’d get bored of first!

One more:

>Absolute scam!! Manipulated reviews!! (1 star):
>It's a text based game. That's ALL you get. Nothing like any
>review said how fancy and interesting the game play is. I suspect
>all the reviews are done by the developer himself using auto generated review.
>It is done by developer by purchasing the game himself through
>hundreds, if not thousands iTunes account, then give good rating over a period of time.

Here is a review that probably won't be taken down if you report it:

>Not That Brilliant… (1 star):
>The novelty of this game wears down almost immediately after the first time around.
>The whole point of this I suppose is to make us introspective and question
>particular things in the universe. But as much as this game would like you to think,
>you’re not really in control. The fate of the game has pretty much been decided
>and no matter what you do there are pre ordained responses that characters like
>‘the builder’ will have no matter what. I found that incredibly annoying. I guess it got
>the message through to me, but I don’t think of this game as very deep or
>thought-provoking. Give me Angry Birds any day and I’ll ponder the
>higher meaning of destroying smiling green pigs >while actually believing
>that my 1 dollar wasn’t for naught.

Nor this one:

>Not worth the .99 (1 star):
>I beat the game in 2 hours, and the game doesn’t do anything
>to reward you for winning. I like the game but it’s
>missing depth and replay value.

Goes without saying that the take down process is subjective.

**If You Must Do Ads, Do Them Well**

There are good ways to do ads, and then there are stupid ways. Take a look at how
Geometry Dash, Crossy Road, and Threes Free do ads. Each one takes a tasteful approach to.

With regards to an IAPs that remove ads, give the player something additional. There is
novel a tower defense game called Bardbarin. It has an IAP that removes ads,
but also gives you a special item that buffs gold generation.

**IAP's**

I'm not a big fan of IAP's (or ads). So really the only thing I can say with regards
to them is play League of Legends and see how they monetize. I've spent $100+ dollars
on LoL and never have they presented a pop up to get me to buy something. I had
a brief moment of weakness when Trials Frontier presented a pop up, so study how they
entice you to buy IAP (they do a pretty good job).

**Add a Review Button**

Add a review button to your games. If you don't ask for reviews, you won't get them.
You don't want to do a nag review screen. I've seen too many apps that ask for a review
five minutes in... don't do this. Find the perfect time to present a review button
and your conversion rate will significantly increase. Geometry Dash and Duet do a
great job of this. I'd say my games A Dark Room, The Ensign, and A Noble Circle
do a pretty damn good job too.

**Endless Games**

You don't have to make an endless game. You want to build games that people finish
(as opposed to playing a little and deleting). There are games out there that do
endless really well, take a look at Desert Golf, Alto's Adventure,
and You Must Build a Boat. It's important to realize that length does not equal value,
so keep that in mind when deciding on what type of game you build.

Regardless, you want your games to leave the player satisfied. Great examples
of satisfying games (that aren't endless) are Prune, Monument Valley,
Game Dev Story, and (personal plug) A Dark Room.

**Screenshots**

Have screenshots and if at all possible an App Preview Video. The guy that I used
is pretty reasonable about pricing, you can email him at Rule2 Productions:
magill.foote@hotmail.com. He did the video for A Noble Circle
and Michael's new game [GridLand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZhdFcoI0Rw).

For your screenshots, pair them up with words. Few people actually read
the description of your app. Having a screenshot that says "No IAP's, No Ads"
will get noticed significantly more than having it in the description. Take a look
at Blek's screenshots. They do a great job of pairing screenshots with words.

**Promotion Codes**

Give them away like candy (especially since you're releasing so often).
If you reach out to editors or reviewers, just send redemption codes with
the initial email you send out. The worst thing you can do is say "email me
back and I'll send you codes." They won't email you back, and they won't
take a look at your game.

**Cloning Other Games**

Create derivative works. Study games you like and recreate
it with your style. Geometry Dash is a great example of a derivative work.
You can tell that it's heavily inspired by Impossible Game, but simply
does a better job. Another game that (imho) does a better job than the "original"
game is Sword of Xolan (which "copied" Goblin Sword).

**Free Versions**

Geometry Dash has a free version and a paid versions. Having this kind of offering
keeps cloners from trying to capitalize on your success. See what I've done
with A Noble Circle - Prologue (free). If you have a complex game, it's unlikely
you have to worry about creating a free version. No cloner would take the time
to make Monument Valley. But Threes unfortunately got cloned pretty quickly. So
be conscious of this dynamic and plan accordingly.

It's also worth noting that the App Store customer base is simply divided. There are those
that buy games and those that don't. It doesn't seem like they cross over much.
So it may be beneficial to provide both versions if that's something that your game can work with.

**Have an Identity**

You will (hopefully, eventually) find your style. I know exactly what kind
of game I will get when I get a game from Bossa Studios (the guys that made
Surgeon Simulator and I am Bread). I know exactly what kind of game I'll get
when I get a game from Supergiant Games (the guys that made Bastion and Transistor).
People who buy my games know exactly what kind of game they will get, too.

As an indie game developer, you can capitalize on "having heart" (as opposed to
the souless AAA companies). Take a look at Space Team
(you can "feel" the heart this game has, even though it
looks unpolished).

You want to get to a point where people say "Oh, Amir
built this game. I'm gonna buy it." Having this kind of identity keeps you
from having to create sequels/"franchises". It gives you the freedom
to be creative with other genres.

One game won't make you rich. The App Store is extremely volatile and fickle,
so you'll need multiple assets to have a good, consistent income. Having an
identity that is more than just a game will help with that sustainability.

**Do it for Love**

Guys and gals, we're lucky. We have the ability to release a game that can
be something special to someone living on the other side of the world
(with very little monetary investment). Before A Dark Room went viral,
I found meaning and success in what I did simply because I
inspired some teenagers to get into game development, and brought
a great gaming experience to the blind. I find meaning posting
and collaborating here. I find meaning in presenting and writing about game development
(none of which really generates money).

A Noble Circle has modest downloads, but I'm so happy seeing glowing reviews
and receiving a single email about how a father and son connected while
playing it. So relish in those small wins, they'll make all the work you
put into your games worth it (even if your game fails financially...which it probably will). I can
only do game development part time (it doesn't pay all the bills), but damn
do I have a great time building them.

# How to Market Your Game on Reddit

**tl;dr;**

_You don't market on Reddit. You have **genuine interactions** on
Reddit. You **give gold**, and **participate** in the community/subreddit
you're posting on. You have to be a good citizen. You **cannot**
"growth hack" this._

## What You Need to Do Before Posting ##

You have to be a good member of the Reddit community as a whole (this
is applicable for any community or forum frankly).

1. You have to have the karma and membership longevity. If you created
   your account just today. It's unlikely any post you put up
   will get attention. In fact, karma and membership longevity is a key
   component moderators use to determine if they should right out ban
   you from even posting to a subreddit after an infraction. So, if
   you don't have that, then take some time to get familiar with the
   site, and participate.

2. Read the forum rules. Many many subreddits frown upon marketing
   and self promotion. So you need to be respectful of these
   rules. Look at top posts for that community to get a feel of what
   they like upvoting.

3. If a subreddit allows for _some_ marketing/self promotion. Then get
   permission from the moderators _first_. Here is an example message
   I sent to a moderator before posting about A Dark Room's Android
   release:

Subject:

>I'm the creator of A Dark Room. Wanted to get your permission before posting.

Body:

>Wanted to get your permission to give away promotion codes for A Dark
>Room Android. Here is the way I was planning on giving them away
>(it's a combination of a discussion starter and an AMA of a
>successful indie game dev). What do you think?
>
>[Full Text of Post was included]

I was given permission to post, but another moderator felt otherwise
and took the post down. I appealed and got this response:

>Sorry I wasn't here, he messaged me earlier and I figured it was
>good. There is a fair bit of commenting on self-promotional posts in
>the last couple of weeks which I would expect when someone releases a
>game. But I went back a page or two and saw plenty of content and
>effort put into posts and comments. That and the Reddit gold/gilding
>and age of account so it tipped the scale in my opinion towards being
>allowed.

>I wasn't around to follow up on it so I'm sorry about that. I didn't
>even realize it was a regular message until after I replied to him,
>but I should have forwarded it to modmail once I realized it.

4. Don't be a sleazeball spammy marketer. You know exactly what
   I'm talking about. Don't do it. This stuff takes effort (it's also
   fun if you do it because you actually love your product, and love
   interacting with the community you're pitching too). After I did
   the post, here is the message I got from the moderator:

>It really did turn out well. Probably some of the best comments ever
>on the subreddit. Glad you engaged the users instead of just giving
>everything away. Good stuff. Wish there were more game developers
>like you.

## How to Post on Reddit ##

The one subreddit you should always always post to if you're doing a
promotion (specifically for premium games) is
[/r/AppHookup](http://reddit.com/r/apphookup). Here is how NOT to post
there (or anywhere for that matter):

>I built a game! Here are 30 promocodes! Enjoy!
>[Some salespitchy description of game with links].
>[Big list of promocodes].

Why not post like this? Well, it's simple. This kind of post **doesn't
elicit comments other than "thanks!"**. The promocodes will be redeemed
quickly (either by a bot or lurkers), and then your post will be
downvoted and eventually deleted. Plus, it's lazy.

**Here is an example of a good post:**

Subject:

>[iPhone] Promo Code Give Away for A Dark Room RPG, Celebrating another release!

Body:

>Updates to A Dark Room got released. And I received some media coverage!
>
>To celebrate, I'm giving away **10** promo codes for A Dark Room RPG.
>
>Rules to get a promo code:
>
>- Read the recent interview by Gamasutra about A Dark Room: A Dark Room's unique journey from the web to iOS
>- Add a comment to this post, **commenting about something you read in the article** (please be sure to do this)
>- Get a promo code via private message :-)

**Here is an even better example:**

This is the one that got me at the top spot in
[/r/AndroidGaming](http://reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming). The subreddit
allows for small bits of self promotion. So to be on the safe side, I
emailed the moderator first and got the thumbs up.

Subject:

>Giving away Redemption Codes for my #1 iOS app's debut on Android - A Dark Room :-)

Body:

>Hey everyone! I wanted to do a promo code giveaway for my game [A Dark Room](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yourcompany.adarkroom). Here is a list of things the game has accomplished (most of these accolades are from the iOS version since I deployed there first):

>- No Ads, no microstransactions, no elevated security privileges, no data usage.
>- 2.26 million downloads in under two years (free and paid combined).
>- Awarded Apple's Top 10 Paid Apps of 2014
>- #1 game in the US for 18 days straight on iOS (20 days overall).

users. Thanked them for telling me what they were passionate about
(even gave Reddit gold to one of them because their passion was
taking care of orphans).** The promotion lasted for two days (I ended
up extending it because of its popularity). This took _time_, I spent
hours replying to comments, answering questions, and sending out
redemption codes via private message. Total comments for the post was
_78_, and I ended up giving away 25 codes. That's a lot of comments
(and a lot of work).

## Applying This Interaction Technique Outside of Reddit ##

You can use these same techniques outside of Reddit of course. I'm
still perferially working on Beautiful Go (a digital Go Board for
enthusiasts). I try to find _active_ forums across the Internet
(however large or small).

The text for those posts have minor differences, mostly because the
app is still in active development. I give away redemption codes in
exchange for feedback. I'll then update the app, and post again on
those same forums (showing that I'm invested in their community and
building a good product).

The underlying concept is still the same.

- I'm participating in the community.
- I'm showing that I'm genuine (in the case of the Go community, I'm
  showing that I love the game, and listen to their feedback with
  every update).
- I'm not a sleazeball, lazy, spammy marketer.
- I'm not a sleazeball, lazy, spammy marketer.
- I'm not a sleazeball, lazy, spammy marketer.
- One more thing. I'm not a sleazeball, lazy, spammy marketer.

# How to Market Your Game on Reddit

**tl;dr;**

_You don't market on Reddit. You have **genuine interactions** on
Reddit. You **give gold**, and **participate** in the community/subreddit
you're posting on. You have to be a good citizen. You **cannot**
"growth hack" this._

## What You Need to Do Before Posting ##

You have to be a good member of the Reddit community as a whole (this
is applicable for any community or forum frankly).

1. You have to have the karma and membership longevity. If you created
   your account just today. It's unlikely you'll get any forum post
   will gain attention. In fact, karma and membership longevity is a key
   component moderators use to determine if the should right out ban
   you from even posting to a subreddit. So, if you don't have that,
   then take some time to get familiar with the site, and participate.

2. Read the forum rules. Many many subreddits frown upon marketing
   and self promotion. So you need to be respectful of these
   rules. Look at top posts for that community to get a feel of what
   they like upvoting.

3. If a subreddit allows for _some_ marketing/self promotion. Then get
   permission from the moderators _first_. Here is an example message
   I sent to a moderator before posting about A Dark Room's Android
   release:

Subject:

>I'm the creator of A Dark Room. Wanted to get your permission before posting.

Body:

>Wanted to get your permission to give away promotion codes for A Dark
>Room Android. Here is the way I was planning on giving them away
>(it's a combination of a discussion starter and an AMA of a
>successful indie game dev). What do you think?
>[Full Text of Post was included]

I was given permission to post, but another moderator felt otherwise
and took the post down. I appealed and got this response:

>Sorry I wasn't here, he messaged me earlier and I figured it was
>good. There is a fair bit of commenting on self-promotional posts in
>the last couple of weeks which I would expect when someone releases a
>game. But I went back a page or two and saw plenty of content and
>effort put into posts and comments. That and the Reddit gold/gilding
>and age of account so it tipped the scale in my opinion towards being
>allowed.

>I wasn't around to follow up on it so I'm sorry about that. I didn't
>even realize it was a regular message until after I replied to him,
>but I should have forwarded it to modmail once I realized it.

4. Don't be a sleazeball spammy marketer persona. You know exactly what
   I'm talking about. Don't do it. This stuff takes effort (it's also
   fun if you do it because you actually love your product, and love
   interacting with the community you're pitching too). After I did
   the post, here is the message I got from the moderator:

>It really did turn out well. Probably some of the best comments ever
>on the subreddit. Glad you engaged the users instead of just giving
>everything away. Good stuff. Wish there were more game developers
>like you.

## How To Post ##

The one subreddit you should always always post to if you're doing a
promotion (specifically for premium games) is
[/r/AppHookup](http://reddit.com/r/apphookup). Here is how NOT to post
there (or anywhere for that matter):

>I built a game! Here are 30 promocodes! Enjoy!
>[Some salespitchy description of game with links].
>[Big list of promocodes].

Why not post like this? Well, it's simple. This kind of post **doesn't
elicit comments other than "thanks!"**. The promocodes will be redeemed
quickly (either by a bot or lurkers), and then your post will be
downvoted and eventually deleted. Plus, it's lazy.

**Here is an example of a good post:**

Subject:

>[iPhone] Promo Code Give Away for A Dark Room RPG, Celebrating another release!

Body:

>Updates to A Dark Room got released. And I received some media coverage!
>
>To celebrate, I'm giving away **10** promo codes for A Dark Room RPG.
>
>Rules to get a promo code:
>
>- Read the recent interview by Gamasutra about A Dark Room: A Dark Room's unique journey from the web to iOS
>- Add a comment to this post, **commenting about something you read in the article** (please be sure to do this)
>- Get a promo code via private message :-)

**Here is an even better example:**

This is the one that got me at the top spot in
[/r/AndroidGaming](http://reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming). The subreddit
allows for small bits of self promotion. So to be on the safe side, I
emailed the moderator first and got the thumbs up.

Subject:

>Giving away Redemption Codes for my #1 iOS app's debut on Android - A Dark Room :-)

Body:

>Hey everyone! I wanted to do a promo code giveaway for my game [A Dark Room](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yourcompany.adarkroom). Here is a list of things the game has accomplished (most of these accolades are from the iOS version since I deployed there first):

>- No Ads, no microstransactions, no elevated security privileges, no data usage.
>- 2.26 million downloads in under two years (free and paid combined).
>- Awarded Apple's Top 10 Paid Apps of 2014
>- #1 game in the US for 18 days straight on iOS (20 days overall).
>- 26,859 ratings of which 23,833 are 5-stars (4.73 average rating).
>- Publications in Huffington Post, Slate, and The New Yorker.

>- Reviewed on Touch Arcade (4 stars) and Cult of Mac (5 stars)

>#How to get a redemption code (I'll be giving away codes till end of July 26th)

>1. Forgive me for deploying to Android after iOS.
>2. Remember that I love what I do, more than anything really.
>3. Read this short story I wrote called ["I'd Give Anything"](http://amirrajan.net/rant/2014/11/30/id-give-anything/)

# How to Contact Apple About Your Game

**tl;dr;**

_Getting featured by Apple is incredibly difficult. Their criteria is
completely subjective. Large AAA companies are favored over all. If
you're an indie developer, it's unlikely you'll get featured._

**Background**

I'm the creator of A Dark Room iOS. It's a minimalist text based RPG
that went viral and became the #1 app. Here's a list of all the things
this game has accomplished.

- 2.26 million downloads in under two years (free and paid combined).
- \#1 game in the US for 18 days straight (20 days overall).
- 26,859 ratings of which 23,833 are 5-stars (4.73 average rating).
- Publications in [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/01/a-dark-room-iphone-game_n_5241335.html), [Slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/05/21/a_dark_room_the_cormac_mccarthy_of_text_based_iphone_games.html), and [The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/a-dark-room-the-best-selling-game-that-no-one-can-explain).
- Richard Garriott (creator of Ultima Online) talks about [A Dark Room](http://amirrajan.net/assets/images/a-dark-room-richard-garriott.mp3) on [Axe of the Blood God](https://soundcloud.com/usgamernet/axe-of-the-blood-god-episode-2)
- Reviewed on [Touch Arcade](http://toucharcade.com/2014/06/03/a-dark-room-review/) (4 stars) and [Cult of Mac](http://www.cultofmac.com/277118/dark-room-lights-app-store-big-heart-open-world/) (5 stars)

**Even with all of these accomplishments. Getting _any_ of my games featured is an uphill battle. You
_need_ to understand this. To reiterate, there is very little chance that your game will get featured.**

But I'll try to provide some tips that will put you in the best position possible.

**The Ugly**

Publishers are not created equal. It's something I learned very quickly when trying to understand
the App Store feature mechanics. If you are Warner Brothers, SquareEnix, Kim Kardashian, King, etc,
you get a red carpet to getting featured. You can release whatever trash or shoddy port you want,
and you'll get featured. So you have two options, accept this and **play by the rules I'm about
to lay out, or don't participate**.

## A List of Do's and Dont's ##

Here's the list of tips you need. You really need to do all these things. It's how you show Apple
that they can take you seriously as a game developer.

**Do: App Preview Video**

Your game needs a preview video. Without a preview video, you significantly limit your chances
of getting featured. There are plenty of examples of good preview videos out there, so make
one for your game if you are serious about getting featured.

**Do: Good App Description and Screenshots**

Your game needs to have a compelling description and good screenshots. Look at other featured
apps to see what constitutes a good app description and screenshots.

**Do: Localized?**

Is your app localized? It isn't? Good luck getting a feature (this is the primary thing that's
keeping A Dark Room from being considered for anything other than the Best New Game Updates category).

**Do: Email _After_ Your App Is Approved**

If your app is new, you need to make sure your game is already sitting in the "Ready For Release by Developer".
Additionally, you need to give Apple at least three weeks of lead time for consideration. Even if you have an
incredible game, if you only give Apple a couple day's notice, you wont get featured.

**Don't: Releasing During a Holiday Week**

Don't submit feature requests during holiday weeks (unless your game is holiday themed in nature). There
is so much competition against AAA game companies along with an influx of shovelware related to holiday X.
You'll just be lost in the noise, so take those months to do polish releases, minor bug fixes, etc.
Don't release during New Years, Valentines, Christmas, Thanksgivings, etc.

**Don't: It's Your First App**

Apple wants to showcase developers that have experience. If this is your first app/game, it's unlikely
you'll get a feature (unless the app is exceptional).

**Don't: Spinoffs/Clones**

If you're going to pitch "Crossy Road, BUT BETTER!!", just don't bother. It's a great way to get immediately
dismissed.

**Do: Buy Featured Games (Know Your Competition)**

If you don't buy featured apps, how can you objectively tell if your app can compete? You don't have to
buy apps by AAA companies, just apps by other indie devs. Here's my list:

- Monument Valley
- Hoplite
- Alto's Journey
- You Must Build a Boat
- A Dark Room
- Device 6
- The Room
- Downwell
- Her Story
- ALONE...
- Plague Inc.
- Lifeline...
- Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP
- Desert Golf
- Deemo
- Cytus
- Tiny Wings
- Leo's Fortune
- Sometimes You Die
- Blek
- Dark Echo
- Piloteer
- Prune

**Do: Use New Apple Features**

Using these techs will help you get Apple's attention:

- SceneKit
- SpriteKit
- 3D Touch
- Replays
- Apple Watch
- Apple TV
- Game Center

**Do: Release Every Six Weeks**

Apple wants to see apps that are updated frequently. If you don't get featured as a new game. Don't lose
too much hope, you can always get featured as an update. Updates should be non-trivial. If you are doing
just bug fixes/minor tweaks, you won't get featured for that. So make your updates enticing. Updating
(and sending feature requests) too often overloads the Apple team. A six week release cycle seems to be
a good sweet spot.

## How to Contact Apple About Your Game ##

Redacted. Sorry guys. You gotta figure this out yourself.

## 2016 Dates You Should and Shouldn't Release and Why ##

Here is a list of dates in 2016 that you should and should not release
on. _Always_ release Wednesday night. Thursday is when Apple features
apps and games. So releasing on Wednesday will put you in the running
for best new games and game updates. You want to have your app
approved and "Pending Developer Release" three weeks before your release
date so that the editorial team (and company) has a chance to preview
your app and see if they want to include it in their feature list.

Here are a list of dates to release on for 2016:

- Jan 6: First week of the year. The competition will be high, but
  revenue in general is higher during the beginning of the
  year. Everyone one has a brand new iDevice to buy apps for.
- Jan 13: Another good day. It's at the beginning of the year and
  there are no looming holidays around the corner.
- Jan 20: All clear. No holidays around the corner, still in the
  first of the month!
- Jan 27: This is a no go day. Super Bowl is just around the
  corner and so is Valentine's day. It's unlikely that your app will
  get featured during this time period.
- Feb 3: Nope. Super Bowl 50 is on the 7th. Don't release on this
  day because the only apps that will be featured will be those
  promoting football by AAA companies. Double no because February 8th
  is the Chinese New Year.
- Feb 10: Nope. Valentine's days is around the corner.
- Feb 17: Valentine's day is over and this is a great time to get
  your game out ahead of Spring Break.
- Mar 9: Nope. St. Patrick's Day on the 17th. AAA games that decide
  to add a four leaf clover to their app will get featured.
- Mar 16: Nope. St. Patrick's Day on the 17th. AAA games that decide
  to add a four leaf clover to their app will get featured.
- Mar 23: Nope. Easter Sunday on March 27th.
- Mar 30: Nope. Baseball season starts on April 4. No dates in March
  are good really. Besides, Spring Break will be in full swing, so you
  should get some good revenue if you hit the February 17th release date.
- Apr 6: Good time to release a game. Usually games don't get much
  branding for tax season. This and most AAA companies will be
  preparing for big summer blockbusters. Same with movies that will
  create a ton of Shovelware. The chance to get featured in April are
  generally higher I'd say.
- Apr 13: May not be a terrible day to release, but Father's day is
  around the corner.
- Apr 20: Earth day around the corner. AAA games will get first shot
  at Earth themed updates (plus proceeds will go to saving the Earth charities).
- Apr 27: Probably not as good as the other days in April. Cinco de
  Mayo and Mother's day is just around the corner.
- May 4: No way. Mother's day on May 8th. May the fourth be with
  you. Revenge of the fifth! And then a Captain America movie comes
  out on the 6th.
- May 11: Good time to release.
- May 18: Also a good time to release and possibly get featured.
- May 25: Memorial day is just around the corner. Chances of your apps
  getting featured over bigger names is unlikely.
- Jun 1: Apple events around the corner. They may turn off the App Store.
- Jun 8: Good day, other than the Warcraft moving coming out.
- Jun 15: Good day!
- Jun 22: Nope. Independence Day Resurgence will release during this
  time. Expect alien invasion games to get featured along with ID4
  shovelware.
- Jun 29: Nope. July 4th is just around the corner.
- Jul 6: We are into the summer days at this point. You'll need to
  watch for when summer blockbuster movies will come out.
- Jul 13: Good day I think. Depends on how much hype the Ghostbusters
  and Jason Bourne movies gets.
- Jul 20: Star Trek beyond is coming out. Expect a lot of space games
  to get featured during this time period.
- Jul 27: Godzilla movie hitting the box office July 29th. Why is
  there always some hurdle for us indie devs to overcome?
- Aug 3: Looks like a good day to release for a chance to get featured.
- Aug 10: Same here. You have to again keep an eye on blockbuster
  AAA companion apps or other movies. But generally speaking it looks
  like this would be a good time to release and reach out to Apple.
- Aug 17: Same here. Again, keep in mind that summer is a busy time
  for apps and fun in general. It'll be competitive, but relatively a
  good time to push new updates to your apps.
- Aug 24: Probably safe to release.
- Aug 31: Labor day around the corner. Can't think of any game themes
  centered around labor, so it may be fine to release. If you have a
  solid game and a good number of reviews, I'd wait it out until the
  holiday is over.
- Sep 7: Everyone will be in full swing developing things for the
  holiday season. Surprisingly, this would be a good time to release
  your games and gain some visibility
- Sep 14: Same as September 7.
- Sep 21: Same as September 7.
- Sep 28: Same as September 7.
- Oct 5: NBA playoffs and Columbus Day are around the corner. Other
  than that, it may be a good time to release before the holiday
  season. That and beta release of the new OS should be dropping
  around this time. So you'll probably be busy with play testing and
  regression.
- Oct 12: Most apps are going to have their reviews reset at this
  point (because they are releasing updates in preparation for the
  next version of iOS). This is a good time to do the same.
- Oct 19: Same here as Oct 12 and Oct 5.
- Oct 26: Halloween. Got a scary game? It may be a good time to talk
  to Apple. Remember to start the conversations with Apple early. Your
  game should be "Pending Developer Release" three weeks before the
  Wednesday you plan to release.
- Nov 2: Holiday season begins. All the big companies will be getting
  games out ahead of Christmas. It's unlikely you'll get featured.
- Nov 9: Same here. Probably best not to release/update your
  game. Concentrate on getting your games supported for the new
  devices that are coming out and prepare for a January update (unless
  you are using deprecated API's at which point you have to release).
- Nov 16: Turkey day is approaching, and holiday season in
  general. You'll be hard pressed to get a feature during this time period.
- Nov 23: Turkey days and holidays. Unlikely you'll get featured.
- Nov 30: Out of the holiday Wednesdays, this would be an okay day to
  release.
- Dec 7: Out of the holiday Wednesdays, this would be an okay day to
  release too.
- Dec 14: I'd refrain from releasing or updating before
  Christmas. Having a solid review count and good App Page is more important.
- Dec 21: Nope. Christmas.
- Dec 28: Nope. New Years is around the corner.

# The In's And Out's of the Review and Ranking System

Here is what I've learned about how apps get ranked in the App
Store. I'm sure some of this isn't perfect, but this is what I've
observed after obsessively watching A Dark Room's rank rise and fall
over 2 years.

### Downloads Over a Four to Five Day Moving Average Dictate Rank

The ranking system bumps the rank of apps that have consistent
download numbers over a "long" period of time. Having a huge spike,
followed by nothing, will temporarily bump your app a few spots for a
few hours... but that's really it.

### You Need a 8k to 10k Downloads a Day to Hit The #1 (Premium) Spot in the US

To hit the number one spot in the premium App Store, you need a
sustained 8 to 10k downloads a day (the moving average is
important). Once you're at that spot, D-day will get you _20,000 downloads_.

Here are relative App Store sizes for other countries (the list shows
the number of downloads needed to reach various spots).

- United States: Top #100 apps: 1k DL's, Top #10 apps: 5k DL's, #1 app: 10k DL's
- Canada: Top #10: 500 DL's, #1 app: 1k DL's
- United Kingdom: Top #100 apps: 100 DL's, Top #10 apps: 1k downloads, #1 app: 5k downloads
- Australia: Top #10 apps: 200 downloads, #1 app: 700 downloads
- New Zealand: #1 app: 200 downloads
- Singapore: #1 app: 80 downloads
- Germany: #1 app: 1k downloads
- South Africa: #1 app: 15 downloads
- India: #1 app: 15 downloads

Some things worth noting about rankings across countries:

- The ranking systems are completely independent. Being #1 in one
  country doesn't have any direct impact on another countries rank.
- Going viral in the UK does indirectly impact going viral in the US.
- Going viral in the US does indirectly impact going viral in Canada.
- Going viral in AUS does indirectly impact going viral in New Zealand
  and Singapore.

The number of downloads to reach the top of your category varies based
on category.

For example, it takes A Dark Room ~500 downloads to stay at the #1
spot in the RPG category, but only gives me the #8 spot in the
Adventure category.

It takes A Noble Circle ~40 downloads to stay in the top 10 of the
Music category (and doesn't even rank in the top 150 RPG category... usually).

The Ensign (the pre-sequel to A Dark Room) hovers around the top 50
RPG's at 50 downloads a day.

### You Need 100,000 downloads to reach the #1 (Free) Spot in the US

Generally speaking you need 10x the number of downloads to reach the
same ranks in the free App Store. When A Dark Room was the #3 free iOS
App (out ranked by Facebook's Messenger and Crazy Taxi), it got
a _quarter of a million downloads on D-day_ (I kept it free for only one
week, since I don't have ads or IAP... just wanted to spread the word
about the game).

### How Much Does Minecraft Make?

Given this information (and the fact that Minecraft is pretty much
the number one iOS game year round), I can project what they make on
sales, assuming the following:

- Price Point: 6.99
- Downloads Per Day: 8k to 10k (we'll go with the low end)
- Time At #1 Spot: 365 days

Daily Revenue (conservative): $55,920
Yearly Revenue (conservative): $20,410,800

### Heads Up! Gets Special Treatment

Alright, just throwing this out there. But after three years of
watching the App Store, I've come to the conclusion that Heads Up (the
app created by Warner Bros and endorsed by Ellen Degeneres) gets
special treatment in rankings.

Let's look at the lifetime reviews for games surrounding Heads Up:

- Number 1 Spot: Minecraft: 451,612
- Number 3 Spot: Plague Inc.: 138,970
- Number 4 Spot: Geometry Dash: 224,832
- Number 5 Spot: Bloons TD 5: 39,868

And what are the review numbers for Heads Up? _6,977_. Why has Heads
Up! stayed at the #2 spot for so long? Maybe the following:

### Lifetime Rank (and age of app) Influences Immediate Rank

One thing that does influence your current rank is how long your game
has been out, and what rank it's held during that time period. There
is a "reset" that occurs in the App Store. I've observed this
happening (at least) once every quarter. For one day, it looks like app ranks are
"reset" to the lifetime average for a given app. There have been
numerous times where ADR has slipped down to the #50 spot in the RPG
category, and then the next day it's at #5... without any increase in
downloads. And of course, when you are "above the fold", your
downloads organically increase (thus solidifying your spot). This is
probably what has happened to Heads Up... though I doubt it.

### A Bit More Analysis on How Lifetime Rank Influences Current Rank

There is a very strong corellation between rank vs downloads. But
there are points of drops - and lack there of - too. Here is graph of
downloads (teal solid color) vs rank (blue line). You'll see points
where my rank dropped even though my sales were steady (red arrows),
and also where my rank _didn't_ drop, when sales were falling (green
arrows). Aside from download numbers, there seems to be another
component in play that affects rank. I believe that this component is
what keeps games like Heads Up! at the rank it currently holds.

![Rank vs Revenue](manuscript/images/rank-vs-rev.png)

### Review System

Here is what I've learned about the review system.

- Reviews sell games. Keep your review count high (hell, even make
  your app free after a release to get an influx of new users and reviews).
- People who are given a promotion code will not have their review registered.
- Whenever you do a new release of your app, the current reviews that
  your app has, get archived. You can use this knowledge to sweep bad
  reviews under the rug.
- Five star reviews show up at the top, but can come after four star
  reviews _if_ the four star review is longer.

Here is the top five star review for ADR (all time):

>With all the mindless apps out there now like Clash of Clans and
>Candy Crush, this app lives in a perfect environment to set itself
>apart, and that it does. While I don't want to ruin anything, I can

Here is the _first_ four star review that is _above_ a (shorter) five
star review:

The four star review clocks in at approximately 228 words.

There are actually longer five star reviews of the games, but it seems like
there is a top end to the word count (at which point the really really
long reviews are discarded).

**Here is how I've used this information.** Let reviews come in as they
organically should. Then once you have enough good reviews, leave a
review for your own app that is longer than the longest five star
review, _but echoes what all the reviews below say_. By doing
this, you give the customer a positive first impression about your app
(that is repeated by the second, third, and fourth review).

### Holidays Sell Apps

Here are some number for ADR before and on a Holiday:

- November 10, 2015: 161
- November 26, 2015: 232
- December 23, 2015: 166
- December 24, 2015: 164
- December 25, 2015: 286
- December 26, 2015: 325
- Week Before Spring Break 2016: ~400 Dl's a Day
- Week of Spring Break 2016: ~900 Dl's a Day

So, don't put your app on sale during holidays. Put your apps on sale
when you are falling in rank (make your app free even). There are
sydications out there that scrape the App Store for "apps gone on
sale/free"... the syndications get referral money if someone buys an app
using their referral link. So, you'll get some free press from that.

# Interview With Doug Cowley - Hoplite

If you've never played Hoplite. [Go download it right now](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hoplite/id782438457?mt=8). It's a
wonderful turn based strategy game. As I've said before, you have to
research other games and see what they do well. Hoplite is a great
example of a pickup and put down mobile game with high replayability,
no IAP or Ads.

I reached out to the creator to see if I could get an interview with
him about his awesome game. He was kind enough to oblige:

>Doug. Doug. I'm addicted to Hoplite. I know that isn't a question, but I thought I'd just publicly say it.

:)

>How old are you? What's your professional and educational background?

30.

I studied electrical/electronic engineering and worked in that
industry for a few years.  I went on to do some postgraduate
engineering study, which I dropped out of shortly before Hoplite was
made.

>What technologies/frameworks did you use to build Hoplite?

It's written in java and uses libGDX.  At the time, I was only making it for Android as that's what I used.

>How long did it take to build?

Hoplite was originally made for the seven day roguelike challenge.
I'd spent a month or so working on a previous game that didn't really
go anywhere.  I took the "engine" from that previous game and used it
to make the basic mechanics during the challenge.  Releasing the
commercial version for Android and the iOS port took quite a lot
longer.

>How big is the code base?

It's 35k lines of java. I'd estimate the (vast?) majority of that is
for features and content that never made it into the playable game,
though.

>Care to give us some insight into revenue?

I'd rather not make [exact numbers] public. iOS was much greater initially but
mostly dropped away, while Android has remained fairly steady.  To
date, the total revenue is split around 2:1 between Android and iOS.

>During the sale and development of Hoplite, what was one of your happiest moments?

At the time, I was quite excited to see it played and enjoyed by
people in the game industry who had made games I really enjoyed
playing.

>Your saddest moments?

I guess trying to force the game out when I didn't feel like working
on it. I sometimes seem to believe it's necessary.

>You went for a premium game as opposed to a game that was free with IAP. Why?

It might be sentimentality.  That's the way the games where when I
grew up and that's the way I like them.

>Given hindsight is 20/20, would you have done anything differently with regards to building and selling Hoplite?

Sure, just about everything.  Maybe some kind of final boss.  A
different scoring system.  A framework/engine that makes building and
testing on iOS easier.  Probably separate free and premium versions
for Android instead of the current upgrade system.

>The difficulty of Hoplite is perfectly brutal. How did you go about play testing that and fine tuning it?

Lots of experimentation, basically.  Trying to figure out what the
best/worst strategies were and tweaking things to balance them out.
People would still find combinations I hadn't considered that
completely broke the game so the process would take several iterations
each time new abilities were added.

# Interview With Gerard Kelly - Hipster CEO

I wanted to touch on a large swath of game genre's with these
interviews. I connected with Gerard Kelly and his "text based" game
[Hipster CEO](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hipster-ceo/id731368826?mt=8) was incredibly compelling! He was kind enough to share his
experience in developing this game with you.

>How old are you? What's your professional and educational background?

I'm 30 but I built HCEO (the original game) when I was 27. I studied
Computer Science at the National University of Galway in Ireland. I
was an average student at best but I did excel at things I enjoyed -
one of which was programming. When I left University I worked a
corporate junior developer position for a few years before joining a
startup. I've been working for startups or been self-employed ever
since.

From a results standpoint my career was littered with failure until
HCEO. I say from a results standpoint because I did manage to learn a
ton (and get paid) during all those failures. I learnt a lot of
lessons along the way and I've found much more success in recent
years.

>What technologies/frameworks did you use to build Hipster CEO?

Objective-C for the iOS app. Ruby on Rails for the web service for hosting the leaderboards.

There's very few libraries I imported (via CocoaPods or RubyGems). The
simple reason being that there was no real need for such a simple
text-based game.

>How long did it take to build?

The first version took about 3 months to build. Not much crunch
involved - I treated it like a 9 to 5.

I also realised that the success and failure would hinge on successful
marketing so I'd alternate days between marketing and development. So
in reality development probably only took 6-7 weeks. Not bad
considering I'd never built a native app before!

>How big is the code base?

Not huge by any means - I guess theres about 30/40 classes? A cursory
glance in Finder shows that theres 8mb in the project (excluding
assets). Seems high!

>How much lifetime revenue (gross) has the game generated on iOS?

Nearly $32k (USD)

>During the sale and development of Hipster CEO, what was one of your happiest moments?

There were lots! Pre-launch:

Getting featured on BuzzFeed and lots of other news outlets before I'd
even written a line of code was pretty crazy. I'd never worked on a
project that had got such attention before. I'd always felt like I'd
have a flair for marketing and I was vindicated by the interest
generated pre-launch.

Building the brand and the personality and seeing people engage with
it felt like a revelation - like I'd reached the promise land of
building something that a lot of people wanted.

Building a native app for the first time was enjoyable - it felt like
the first time I could touch one of my own projects. It's super easy
to get out of bed in the morning when you have full creative control
but there's a dark side to that too.

Post-launch:

I'll never forget the first week after launching and seeing the game
perform so well in the App Stores. I'm pretty sure it got to #1 game
in my native country - that felt incredible.

When I ran a free campaign mid-last year, the game was downloaded over
40k times in a single day - becoming the #8 most downloaded strategy
game in the US App Store. An amazing feeling.

Meeting people who have heard about the app from all around the
world - going #1 app in several countries - generating a profit from
the project - winning product pitch competitions at tech events and a
music festival. There are a lot of happy moments as a result of HCEO.

>Your saddest moments?

The saddest thing about HCEO is how long its taken me to get the
sequel developed. It's gone through so many iterations over the past 2
years. I flirted with the idea of making it a F2P game and had it 90%
complete when I realised that I really hate F2P games and wasn't
willing to sacrifice the good will HCEO had built up over the years.

Aside from that the only bad thing about the project was being
constantly asked if I'm a hipster during press interviews. Answer:
no.

>What tips do you have for those that are just starting with programming and game development?

Realise that programming is not something that can be learnt overnight
and you need a lot of patience, discipline and work ethic to get good
at it. It'll be quite a while before you can build something that
doesn't appear like complete garbage (and even then it probably still
will be).

Don't jump in too deep. I tried building my own video games at several
different ages growing up and just got overwhelmed. A little less
ambition can be a good thing sometimes too.

If you can, get a job where a more-experienced programmer can mentor
you. The experience will be a hundred thousand times more beneficial
than any tutorial or programming book. This applies for developers of
all levels.

Don't underestimate technical debt. HCEO was my first game and I cut a
lot of corners during development in order to get to market
quickly. That came back to bite me on the ass once or twice.

Don't over-analyse. I've been guilty of spending entire days drafting
up algorithms when I should've just spent an hour planning and got
stuck into code. Consider it a red flag if you find yourself using the
terms "if this and then if that" a lot.

Appreciate the wealth of knowledge and free tools that are available
today thanks to the internet.You wouldn't believe how much easier it
is today to build (and distribute) games compared to not so long ago.

>We may have a couple of project managers reading this interview. Any
>tips for them with regards to managing a project/interacting with
>developers?

Developers are just normal people. Maybe we're a little less sociable
on average than other professions but we're motivated by the same
things as any other workforce.

Want to keep your developers happy?

- Pay them a fair wage
- Enforce a work week of 35-40 hours
- Give them a good chair and educate them on the values of good posture (don't underestimate this one!)
- Realise that that they can probably understand business constraints just as well as you - if you don't have scope to build a feature they're passionate about then explain why

My tips on project management would be:

- Communicate - please, please, please, please communicate clearly and honestly. Not just at the start of the project. Every. Single. Day.
- Make it clear what constitutes a success for the project
- Write a clear, functional spec alongside the development team. Maintain it.
- Encourage ownership for various different aspects/features and hold people accountable
- Unless someone is slacking off, blame is a useless tool
- Don't settle for partially done features that "we'll come back to later". Get it done once and get it done right.
- Deliver incrementally. Deploy and eat your own dog food often.

>Also, we may have a couple of ad men reading this interview. Any tips for them with regards to marketing a game?

Your marketing plan will vary depending on your budget. My budget was
zero dollars so I can only speak to the bootstrappers out there.

Don't knock the hustle. I got most of my write-ups in blogs and print
just by cold-emailing journalists. Do not write generic emails. Find
out who has written about a game similar to yours and pitch
them. Explain why you're unique in the subject title. Don't be afraid
to be a bit blustery in grabbing their attention.

Be bold. There are so many me-too products and games out there. You
need to find a way to stand out unless you have a hefty marketing
budget - being a little controversial and thumbing the nose of status
quo is a good start. Please note that running a TV ad with a
supermodel wearing Gladiator uniform does not pass as being bold. It
passes as being fucking lame.

Understand what makes you unique. Speak the same lingo of your users.

Start immediately. I wouldn't dream of building a game that I couldn't
manage to get a blog to write about. The likelihood of a games
financial success can almost be measured in column inches. Or column
pixels, I suppose.

Build screenshots before you've written a line of code. People want to
see the game. Feel free to just mock something up in Photoshop in
order to pitch it. Make sure they're good though.

Have a website that captures email and run Facebook ads immediately to
get an initial measure on how much it costs to acquire a user. A/B
testing will also help you devise the right messaging and imagery for
your product.

Use viral loops effectively. People love sharing their progress in
games on Facebook and Twitter in exchange for some in-app currency but
present it at the right time (e.g. on level up).

Get your fanbase to spread the word in exchange for early access. For
example, I use my mailing list to get people to tweet about the HCEO 2
in order to maybe get early access. It works pretty well. Some people
have written blog posts. Some people have made Youtube videos.

>You went for a premium game as opposed to a game that was free with IAP. Why?

I think F2P just plain sucks. If I can essentially buy my way to the
top of the heap then where's the real challenge?

>Given hindsight is 20/20, would you have done anything differently with regards to building and selling Hipster CEO?

I definitely wouldn't have spent time flirting with the development of a F2P version.

There's obviously lots of parts of the game I wish I'd done
differently but hopefully I address them in the sequel.

But to be honest, one of the things I'm most proud is how the project
was executed - from a development and marketing perspective - so I
wouldn't really change a whole lot.

# Interview With Ryan Cash - Alto's Adventure

Alto's Adventure is one of my all time favorite iOS games. I get lost
in its artistic presentation and simple game mechanic. Ryan and I
cross paths on Twitter after a one of mention about how awesome Alto
is. After that we've been shooting the bull over email here and
there. I asked if he would let me interview him about his game. Being
the awesome person he is, he said yes. You can read about who Ryan is
at http://ryancash.net/colophon

>Ryan. I loved the feeling of "flow" I got with playing Alto's
>Adventure. It reminded me of the Sega Saturn game Nights into
>Dreams. Just a comment about. Feel free to respond.

Glad to hear this! We actually put a huge emphasis on how the game's
"flow" felt. So it's really cool that you're specifically calling that
out! I think that a game's flow (especially in a game that's supposed
to be viscerally rewarding) is incredibly important. We spent quite a
bit of time making sure this felt right.

>What technologies/frameworks did you use to build Alto?

Alto's Adventure is built in Unity3D.

>How long did it take to build?

Just over 2 years, from idea to the launch.

>During the sale and development of Alto, what was one of your
>happiest moments?

There have been a ton of happy and exciting moments, but I think the
things that have been the most rewarding to see have been the emails
we've received about how the game has helped people cope through an
injury or tough mental situation/illness, and then on the other side
of things, the photos and stories we've heard of really young kids
playing and enjoying the game.

>Your saddest moments?

I don't know if there have been any sad moments, but there have
definitely been stressful moments where I'd wondered how the game
would do before it was finished – countless times questioning myself
late at night or in the shower. The saddest thing for me I think is
that I had a grandfather that had seen the game in its early stages,
but unfortunately passed away before the game was finished and
launched. It would have been great to have shipped the game while he
was still alive.

>What tips do you have for those that are just starting with
>programming and game development?

I'd recommend just immersing yourself in it. Play games. Ask
questions. Network. Reach out to people on the internet. In general,
it's a great community of people willing to help out.

>We may have a couple of project managers reading this interview. Any
>tips for them with regards to managing a project/interacting with
>developers?

There are a bunch of handy tools you can use, like Slack, Basecamp,
Daylite, etc. – but at the end of the day, it just comes down to
having a solid team. If the team structure is there, you'll make it
work.

>Also, we may have a couple of ad men reading this interview. Any tips
>for them with regards to marketing a game?

My biggest tip – start working on your marketing the day you start working on your game.

>You went for a premium game as opposed to a game that was free with
>IAP. Why?

We just felt like this was the right fit for the kind of experience we
made. I go into it a little here:
http://ryancash.net/post/117092406765/the-story-behind-altos-adventure

>Given hindsight is 20/20, would you have done anything differently
>with regards to building and selling Alto?

On the whole, I don't think so. There are always things you learn
along the way, but I think we had learned a lot building and shipping
five other products prior to Alto that allowed us to more or less run
smoothly this time around.

>I hate it when people say "your game is just like X". Do you have any
>thoughts on derivative works?

Most things are deviate of others. The iPod wasn't the first portable
music player. I think there's a big difference between a blatant
ripoff, and drawing inspiration (even heavily) from something else.

>The art in your game is stunning. Any comments on the art direction?

Thanks! We really wanted something that'd stand the test of time, and
something that would also stand the test of non-gamers. And what I
mean by that, is that we wanted the game to appeal to people that
didn't necessarily consider themselves a gamer. We also had the same
goal for non-snowboarders. We wanted to create a piece of art that
just happened to be a video game.

>What kind of emotional rollercoaster did you go through when your
>game was featured by Apple?

I think the majority of the rollercoaster ride occurred in the ~2
years leading up to the release. Once we hit launch day it was mostly
just a blur of excitement and sleepless nights for a couple weeks :)

# Interview With Jurgen Richter-Gebert - iOrnament

So you probably have never heard of iOrnament. It's a quiet little
artistic canvas for drawing mathematically inspired artwork (you'll
get what I mean after you buy and install it). I felt this app and
this interview is important because it shows how having a unique
_intersect_ of programming _and_ expertise in a niche subject matter, can
lead to success.

>How old are you? What's your professional and educational background?

I'm 52 by now. I'm a math professor but always have done a
considerable bit of implementation. My research background is on
geometry. Over the years I worked on several software projects of
different scale. I love visualization and during the last few years I
became really thrilled about questions of UI and UX design.

>What technologies/frameworks did you use to build iOrnament?

Large parts of iOrnament are written in ObjectiveC (using Xcode).
The visualization parts that are performance critical are written in OpenGL ES.

>How long did it take to build?

Difficult to say. Actually the origins of iOrnament date back to 1986
were I wrote a similar program for symmetry visualization on an Atari
for a public exhibition. Over the years I had related projects that
were used in various maths exhibitions. The app iOrnament started as a
kind of design study. The first proof of concept implementation worked
after two weeks. However, it took six months until the first release
was ready. All implementation in parallel to my "daytime job". I never
count time when implementing and most of it happens at night.

>How big is the code base?

The current release is around 2.2MB self written sources. And there
are tons of graphics materials and explanation texts. The first
release was only 650KB.

>How much lifetime revenue (gross) has the game generated on iOS?

All in all around $50K (US)

>During the sale and development of iOrnament, what was one of your happiest moments?

There were several. I always love when I receive artwork from users
that use the app in a way that I never thought would be possible. This
is an incredible feeling, every time when it happens. In the hands of
the right people your app can do more than you imagined. Also direct
contact to some of the users can be very rewarding. I got to know
really incredible people through the app: artists, craftsmen, other
scientists, musicians.

Another happy point was realizing that the average rating of iOrnament
is within the very top of the scale. I first scanned the Education App
Store (80000 Apps at that time) in 2014 and discovered that from all
apps with more than 200 ratings iOrnament was among the Top 25 apps
with respect to rating (even Top 10 in my home country). This feels
good.

>Your saddest moments?

The absolute down point was when I realized that  a (well tested)
version immediately crashed on many US devices. I got 12 1-star
reviews in two days. At that time I was with my family in a very small
B&B place close to Oxford with an almost non-existent internet
connection. In a memorable night shift and with the help of a user in
the US I managed to create an update and submit it to the App Store,
in a kind of internet-slow-motion session paired with panic :-)

Another issue of constant sadness is the impression that Apple does
not get aware of small independent productions even if they are
extremely well rated.

>What tips do you have for those that are just starting with
>programming and game development?

First of all try to have fun with your project. If you enjoy it others
will most probably enjoy it, too. Try to find a topic for your app
that is unique and original. I guess even a simple idea can be quite
successful if it is genuine and well done.

I also think trying to imagine a potential user and how he/she behaves
when interacting with your app is an important step in development. If
you want to survive on the App Store an important step is to avoid
obvious flaws of the App. Users, can be very friendly but they also
can be incredibly rude (in ratings and reviews) if they are
disappointed. So avoid disappointment.

When it comes to programming I recommend to avoid unnecessary
complexity. Do not over-optimize. Focus on one problem at the time and
solve it. Try to create code that is readable even in ten years from
now.

>We may have a couple of project managers reading this interview. Any
>tips for them with regards to managing a project/interacting with
>developers?

Well, iOrnament is a one-person project. However, I very often observe
that the different parts of a development team are having their fights
in my brain (sounds schizophrenic :-) ): The developer in me says
"more features", the marketing person answers "release soon", the UI
designer says "keep it simple", and the manager says "shut up, all
three". All this, no matter if in one person or distributed to many
persons is important. I guess it is relevant to have the various
aspects of a project in mind and to understand the different points of
view. My personal view is that in project development you need many
pragmatic compromises. More features may not always make a program
better. The task of the manager is to understand the specific problems
of the different parts of the project and to find a healthy balance.

>Also, we may have a couple of ad men reading this interview. Any tips
>for them with regards to marketing a game?

I'm by no means a marketing or sales person. However, what I very much
enjoy is contact to real people. iOrnament is a kind of living project
and I have the impression that part of its (moderate) success is that
I try to keep an honest and close dialogue with iOrnament users. This
partially shapes the project. For instance the idea for the Ornament
World Exhibition came from a series of e-mails with  a user (thanks
Anne L.-P.) who send me her creations and I thought: Wouldn't it be
great to share this on a larger scale. The latest release is a
reaction to  users asking for more pro-aspects in the app.

I somehow believe in initial fluctuations. In this philosophy you must
try that the first appearance of your app is as good as possible so
that it creates a kind of positive chain reaction. It is like lighting
a fire with one rod in a dark room :-) I mean that serious.

>You went for a premium game as opposed to a game that was free with IAP. Why?

There are only very few steering mechanisms for an independent
production with only little to no marketing budget. One of these
steering aspects is pricing.

iOrnament alternates longer paid periods and short free
periods. Prince drops and short free periods can (if well announced)
attract many new users. If the app is good, users hopefully leave good
reviews on the App Store which cause a sustain effect for the paid
periods. I have the strong impression that with the alternation of
short free periods and long paid periods all in all one can reach more
users than with each model solely. Currently iOrnament has around
500,000 downloads.

>Given hindsight is 20/20, would you have done anything differently
>with regards to building and selling iOrnament?

Life is life. You make mistakes and if you try to avoid them you will
make others. I really enjoy that iOrnament is a process, an
unplannable road – living. If I knew how to write the ultimate sales
pitch letter to Apple I would write it, but I simply don't. If I knew
in advance that one version would crash in the US, I would have not
released it. But I didn't. Perhaps the one thing I have learned in the
meantime is that it is great to have beta testers. I had a crowd of 40
people testing the latest release and this really was extremely
helpful.

>iOrnament has a good bit of 5 star reviews. What's your secret?

If I knew it, it would reproduce it :-)

First of all good ratings do not necessarily correlate with many
downloads. I have another app out there, that I also like a lot but
which is way less successful (so far :-) ) than iOrnament. It has also
pretty good ratings but much fewer downloads.

If you try to be listed with 5 stars this is a close to impossible
undertaking. (There is a little arithmetic you can do: Being listed
5-stars means you have an average rating of 4.75+ this implies that
every 1-star rating must be compensated by 15 5-star ratings. Every 2
star rating by 11 5-star ratings and so forth). So there are two
important things. Firstly create a good app that relates to the heart
of the users. Secondly give no reason to complain. For this it is also
sometimes reasonable to leave out some features that may create the
desire for even more. There are some reviews of the kind "The app is
great and it would deserve 5 stars, but I only give 4 since I also
want blablabla". It is good to avoid such situations.

Another point is to honestly connect with users. As I said I like the
contact and in an unmeasurable way this helps a lot. It is no shame
for an independent developer to ask people to write honest reviews
(never ask for high ratings this is unethical in my opinion). Trust in
the strength of your product and let the users decide.

# Interview With Sam Barlow - Her Story

Her Story is a very unique experience. My wife and I finished it in
one sitting and loved how we were able to casually participate in what
effectively an interactive fiction. I wanted to interview Sam because
of how different Her Story was from all the other games in the App Store.

>How old are you? What's your professional and educational
>background?

38 years old! Have a 1st class degree in Maths from University of
Bristol. I did some work in the tech/business world out of university
and then fell sideways into videogame development and have about 15
years of experience there -- mostly as a Lead Designer / Game
Director.

>What technologies/frameworks did you use to build Her Story?

Unity, Google Drive, Fade In and Final Cut!

>How long did it take to build?

14 months from blank sheet of paper to shipped game. More than six
months of that was purely on-paper work, research and ideation.

>How big is the code base?

The fact that I don't know the answer to that question might indicate
my level of coding ability -- and the extent to which things were
winged with Unity script and cut and paste.

>How much lifetime revenue (gross) has the game generated on iOS?

I can't give specifics, but the game has sold around 500K copies
across all platforms -- and the App Store accounts for a significant
portion of that.

>How much lifetime revenue (gross) has the game generated on Android
>(if there is one)?

Has just released on Google Play -- so watch this space :)

>During the sale and development of Her Story, what was one of your
>happiest moments?

The first few months of sitting out in my garden in the sun, reading
research materials and sketching out ideas in my notebook :)

>Your saddest moments?

When winter set in and I had to actually finish the thing and fix bugs
with the video plugins! :(

>What tips do you have for those that are just starting with
>programming and game development?

Make something different, that doesn't exist but you feel needs to
exist! Be pretty damn cautious about your estimates in terms of time
and money -- especially if it's your own. Be realistic about the worst
case outcomes and then -- if you can handle them -- commit to seeing
things through, come what may. Something finished and released is
worth a hundred unfinished ideas.

>We may have a couple of project managers reading this interview. Any
>tips for them with regards to managing a project/interacting with
>developers?

Invest in the upfront stuff that doesn't necessarily put results on
screen -- research, ideation, paper design. Give the project time to
breath and answer all the difficult questions before jumping into
execution.

>Also, we may have a couple of ad men reading this interview. Any tips
>for them with regards to marketing a game?

With digital distribution you don't have to sell to everyone. Identify
your niche audience and sell to them -- in some cases excluding a
larger audience. You don't want them dragging you down with poor
reviews or chatter. Put the developer's voice out there as much as
possible -- it's the thing that indie devs can do that bigger
developers can't. There's no PR machine to get in the way, so sell
that authenticity and the personal factor.

>You went for a premium game as opposed to a game that was free with
>IAP. Why?

I'm selling something that has limited content -- it's a 2-5 hour
experience. So I can't monetize the infinite gameplay loop that you
really need to if you want to make a liveable income of IAP. That
said, I went with a price that (at least for Steam) is at the lower
end of the scale -- I wanted to make it easy for people who were
interested to say yes!

>Given hindsight is 20/20, would you have done anything differently
>with regards to building and selling Her Story?

I am in the enviable position of everything having turned out better
than expected! -- from the execution of the game to the buzz around
launch through to the post-launch awards and general chatter. The
reaction from players has been amazing.

I guess the one thing that was difficult was post-launch support. I
recently pulled in a coder to help out with support and to engineer
the Android version and that was a godsend. I was super-frugal with my
planning and so didn't allow for bringing in someone external when the
game was first launched -- with hindsight, I could have allowed myself
that spend, but going into the launch I wasn't prepared to make that
bet!

# Interview With Whitaker Trebella - Piloteer

Piloteer is ridiculously silly. You try to control an unruly jet
pack. Hilarity ensues when trying to "fly" this over zealous
contraption in order to do a number of crazy tricks, and land without
dying. It's a game of mastery, with a great feeling of satisfaction
when you finally land that perfect series of maneuvers.

>QWOP. You like QWOP don't you?

Yes, Piloteer was at least partly inspired by QWOP. I love the
contrast between the simplicity of the controls and the complexity of
the mechanic. I wanted to explore that contrast with a jetpack
mechanic. Plus, I really love the trial-and-error method of learning
how to play QWOP. It frustrates a lot of people but I see it as a fun
challenge.

>How old are you? What's your professional and educational background?

Thirty. Graduated from Indiana University in 2009 with a Music Education
degree. I taught elementary and high school music for 5 years after
college. Meanwhile, on the side, I began composing soundtracks for
indie games. After a year or so of that, I realized I wanted to try
making a game of my own. The problem is that I didn't know anything
about making games or programming. So I taught myself over the
period of about a year and a half, culminating in my first game
Polymer, which I released in 2012. After my second game Pivvot
(2013) I decided I wanted to try going full-time indie, and I have
been ever since!

>What technologies/frameworks did you use to build Piloteer?

Unity with C#.

>How long did it take to build?

About 10 months.

>How much lifetime revenue (gross) has the game generated on iOS?

~$60k.

>How much lifetime revenue (gross) has the game generated on Android
>(if there is one)?

~$2k (didn't get any features or anything).

>During the sale and development of Piloteer, what was one of your
>happiest moments?

I went through so many iterations of the landing code. I wanted the
landing mechanic to feel satisfying, difficult enough to seem
realistic, but easy enough not to alienate everyone who plays it. At
times it was too easy, too hard, too wobbly, too stiff,
etc. etc. etc. Somewhere in the middle of the development period,
after many months of tweaking the landing mechanic, it finally felt
right. This was a great moment.

>Your saddest moments?

After sending out the beta of the game, I got a long response from one
of my good friends. It had many great points about the game that I
took to heart. However, it made me realize how much work was left to
do on the game. Up until receiving that response, I was under the
impression that I was getting close to finishing the game. Turns out I
had many months left of work, and his response really helped me
realize it wasn't even close to ready. It really threw a wrench in my
plans. In hindsight, I'm extremely grateful for that response, because
it resulted in a much better game. But it was tough to come to terms
with at the time.

>What tips do you have for those that are just starting with
>programming and game development?

Keep making games. Just keep making them. Over and over. Lots of
little games. A few bigger games. Participate in game
jams. Participate in gamedev community events. Go to GDC and meet
people. Use Twitter (don't be spammy). When launching a game, hire
someone to do your marketing/PR. Be creative. Experiment. Have fun.

>We may have a couple of ad men reading this interview. Any tips
>for them with regards to marketing a game?

My main marketing tip is to hire a professional. So many indie
developers think they can handle marketing on their own, but often
have no idea what they're doing. A lot of developers also think that
if they're game is good, it'll sell itself, but this is really the
exception to the rule. If you'd consider hiring a professional for
music, art, programming, etc., why wouldn't you hire a professional
for marketing and PR?

>You went for a premium game as opposed to a game that was free with IAP. Why?

So far I've made only premium games. The kind of games I've wanted to
make so far have really fit the premium mold. I wanted Piloteer's
experience to be about learning how to fly a jetpack through trial and
error. Free games tend to need more external motivation to keep
bringing back players, and that's just not the kind of experience I
was going for with this game. Piloteer also fit the premium mold
because of its finite structure. It's a game that (with enough
practice and effort) the player can complete. Free games tend to be
more focused on endless mechanics. I may make a free game in the
future, but Piloteer just wasn't right for that model.

>Given hindsight is 20/20, would you have done anything differently
>with regards to building and selling Piloteer?

I spent too much time on things that were unnecessary for the game's
completion. For example, there were a bunch of obstacles that I
created art assets for that I didn't end up using in the game. I wish
I hadn't focused so much time and energy on things until I was sure
they were going to be in the game.

>You are one of the few people that I know of that have been featured
>by Apple as a "Free Game of the Week". This is a big deal. How many
>downloads did you get during that time period. Did it help your
>premium sales after you went back to paid?

Pivvot got about 2.5 million downloads during that period. Piloteer
got around 1 million. Being a part of that feature is actually very
helpful with premium sales, as it seems to really extend the long
tail. So, while there's a week of "lost" revenue, it is well worth it
in the long run.

>Any other tips with regards to getting featured by Apple? Any "must
>do this or don't come crying to me" kind of stuff?

In my opinion, the most important thing by far is just creating an
incredibly polished game. If your game isn't good or polished, you're
probably out of luck. Add a good marketing person to a polished game
will hopefully get you on Apple's radar!

# Interview With Philipp Stollenmayer - Sometimes You Die, Okay?

Sometimes You Die rose in the App Store ranks to the #1 spots a few
months before A Dark Room did. It was very cool to see an indie
developer succeed with a game that completely broke the iOS
mold. Additionally, Philipp took a different angle with Okay?: it's a
free app with a donation IAP, plus puzzle hints in exchange for
watching an ad (but done tastefully).

>How old are you? What's your professional and educational background?

I am 24 years old and recently made my bachelor's degree in
communication design. Right now I am doing my master thesis in
information design.

>With regards to Sometimes You Die, and Okay?, what
>technologies/languages did you use to build the games? How large are
>the code bases? How long did they take you to make (a short bullet
>list would be perfect)?

I never learned coding professionally, everything I do is
Youtube-taught. Corona SDK uses a quite simple and friendly language,
and the first game that I made has been coded in 3 months, starting
from zero knowledge. I think a professional coder would lose his hair
when he sees the code, but in the end it worked somehow.

Usually, I only have one big code file with 5,000 – 10,000 lines. Not
using a scene manager or something makes me able to make a fluid
navigation, where any screen can animate into any other
screen. Sometimes You Die and the first version of Okay? were
surprisingly comfortable in terms of coding, I needed about 6 weeks
each. The level editor in Okay? was really hard then. I had to make
sure that even the wildest level attempts would work.

>I like to be as transparent as possible with revenue, if that's
>something you can share, that would be awesome. What's the lifetime
>revenue for Sometimes You Die, and Okay?? If you can't give exact
>numbers, could you at least supply relative revenue (example: "X made
>twice as much as Y“).

Sometimes You Die is a paid game, and Okay? has two revenue sources: A
voluntary donation and video ads, that you only see when you need a
hint.

Sometimes You Die made short, but heavy revenue. It was ranked #1
games in USA and Germany for a few days, but decreased quickly. After
2—3 months, the golden age was over. Okay? still makes good revenue,
the first version did not have the video ads, but when I released the
second version, the donation and the ad revenue were both at the same
level. The ad revenue is quite stable, but the donations decreased,
that is not surprising. You donate once, but you keep wanting hints
through the game.

>Between iOS and Android, which platform has brought in the most
>revenue? Percentage breakdown?

The downloads are split very equally. While on Android, paid apps
don't work for me, the donations in Okay? are twice as high as on
iOS. The ad revenue is less than half of the iOS revenue though. All
in all, the revenue is 1/3 Android and 2/3 iOS.

>What were some of the happiest moments during the development of your
>games?

I always wanted to hang on a wall in an art museum, the catch is that
I don't make art. But in 2015, I won the App Art Award from the ZKM,
which is one of the world's leading centers for arts and technology,
for Sometimes You Die. They have a huge area for artistic games, one
story above their art museum, and since then, my game is represented
there. Somewhere between Limbo and Shadow of the Colossus, that makes
me kind of proud.

>The saddest moments?

I have made a game the last three months with an extensive level
editor, which nearly melted my brain. I have put a lot of effort into
that, and made it in a way that I thought Apple would like. Then I saw
on Wednesday that is was featured on the homepage in the US App Store
on second place, thought „so it begins" and cracked the champagne. But
the features are updated on Thursday regularly, and for some reason,
my game was featured one day before that. So on Thursday, a full load
of games squeezed in front of my apps on the home screen, pushing me
to place 8 or so. I was kind of bugged, but not pissed. That came when
I clicked through the App Stores of several countries and realized
that it was featured on no single one but USA. That was kind of
depressing and I put the champagne back in the fridge.

>What tips do you have for those that are just starting with
>programming and game development?

I never saw that the first games are successful. My first successful
app was number 5, and many developers believe that already the first
attempt will bring tons of cash. But it is quite likely that it will
get no attention at all. I get many mails asking why their apps aren't
successful, and in most cases, they are just not designed well. That
means not only the graphics, but also the flow and the
experience. Many developers forget that the main function of a game is
creating a good feeling.

>We may have a couple of project managers reading this interview. Any
>tips for them with regards to managing a project/interacting with
>developers?

I don't have much experience with project managers. But I worked in a
user experience agency for half a year, and realized that the
priorities between designer and programmer are a bit offset. Designers
make mockups and these are recreated by the developer, but a great
user experience is so much more than hopping from image to image. The
user should be supported and guided by animations and transitions,
knowing exactly where he is at the moment, and where to go next.

>Also, we may have a couple of ad men reading this interview. Any tips
>for them with regards to marketing a game?

I am probably a bad marketer. I always ignore the mails from ad
networks and primarily take care of making the game great instead of
the revenue. I could easily implement some ads making me richer, but
what is more important to me is that the gameflow is right.

>Between Sometimes You Die and Okay?, you have games that are both
>premium and free to play with ads/IAP. Do you have any insight with
>regards to when to choose premium vs free to play?

Premium is for quick cash, with the expectation that the cash flow
stops after 2—3 months. Also, there are always a hand full of people
downloading your game. Free to play needs a critical mass to generate
revenue, so you have to make sure this is a game that is easily
enjoyable and well accessible. But once it runs well, it is really
relaxing to see the cash flow.

>Given hindsight is 20/20, would you have done anything differently
>with regards to building and selling your games?

Making apps doesn't cost anything. Some licences for the music,
images, translations, speakers, but I never made an app that was what
I would call expensive. So everything that I earn from them is profit,
physically as well as mentally. It isn't possible to be always
successful, but when you see your mistakes as a chance to learn
something from them, you can lean back at ease.

>Any other tips with regards to getting featured by Apple? Any "must
>do this or don't come crying to me" kind of stuff?

Don't come crying to me if you make a game that isn't fun. You can
hire the best designers and brainstorm the shit out of you, in the end
it has to be fun. Make user tests! Most games fail within the first
minute. That is the most important thing that I have learnt.

# Interview With Yacine Salmi - Ellipsis

The most concise way of describing Ellipsis is that it's
psychedelically beautiful. The control scheme/responsiveness is spot
on and the game as a whole is just extremely polished (this kind of
quality is what you should strive for).

>How old are you? What's your professional and educational background?

I'm 35. I did a BSc in software engineering as a Bachelor's and a
Master's in Games Programming (basically to help me break into the
Games Industry...it worked :)). I've worked for Criterion Games (EA)
on the Burnout Series, then at Evolution Studios (Sony) on Motorstorm
and later at Havok on their physics and destruction team. I developed
a strong core in physics and animation programming.

I should mention that we are a two-man team. My colleague Stefan Hell
is a young graduate from the Technical University of Munich and is a
talented programmer in his own right.

>What technologies/frameworks did you use to build Ellipsis?

We used Unity, which was the simplest engine to quickly prototype
with. We've had to enhance our solution with a lot of custom native
plugins and shader code to achieve the visual performance required.

>How long did it take to build?

We built it over two years, the first year being very part-time and
roughly full-time the last 11 months. Much longer than you would want
for a mobile game.

>How big is the code base?

Roughly 40k lines of code, not including custom native plugins.

>How much lifetime revenue (gross) has the game generated on iOS?

Roughly €20k so far.

>How much lifetime revenue (gross) has the game generated on Android
>(if there is one)?

Roughly €2k so far.

>During the sale and development of Ellipsis, what was one of your
>happiest moments?

Basically every time someone falls in love with the game and shares
their experiences with us. It's a short, fleeting yet incredible burst
of pleasure. Specifically:

- During public play tests when players can't seem to let go of the
  tablet.
- When Ron Carmel expressed his surprised delight at playing the
  Game. Ron is a huge inspiration and one of the reasons I got into
  games.
- When a 12-year old Brit started making fan videos of the game.

>Your saddest moments?

Hmmm, seeing all the piracy? You eventually get over it and accept
that you would never have those sales anyways, but it's a bit
disheartening to what extent people will go to pirate games from indie
developers.

>What tips do you have for those that are just starting with
>programming and game development?

Don't focus on making a hit indie game or becoming successful. Focus
on making games and releasing them and learning from your experiences
and iterating. Try to create as many ideas as you can as quickly as
you can. Release early and often. Don't be afraid of throwing away
your work and starting again. I think this is the single most
important way to become proficient in programming and game
development. Do, Test, Analyze, Repeat.

>We may have a couple of project managers reading this interview. Any
>tips for them with regards to managing a project/interacting with
>developers?

There entire books written on this subject that do it better justice,
but I would boil it down to:

- Empower your developers to make decisions and feel ownership of the
  product.
- Focus on eliminating obstacles that prevent your developers from
  making progress.
- Include them in the planning and estimation of tasks.
- Double whatever time estimate your developers give you.

>Also, we may have a couple of ad men reading this interview. Any tips
>for them with regards to marketing a game?

Focus on what makes your game unique, what makes it stand out from the
rest. Try to sell your unique story and why players should pay
attention to your game as opposed to the thousands of other great
games that come out all the time.

>You went for a premium game as opposed to a game that was free with
>IAP. Why?

Probably this was a mistake. Setting up IAP purchases required more
work (doing a validation server) and we couldn't quite figure out how
to present an IAP purchase without relying on text.

I also wanted to avoid the inevitable lower average ratings we would
receive from having a 'free' version.

However, this is possibly just hubris and trying to post-hoc justify a
decision. Doing a Free + IAP is probably  the more sensible
solution. And even now we are putting the final touches on a free demo
version which redirects you to the full game once you've finished
it. I call it "indie IAP".

>Given hindsight is 20/20, would you have done anything differently
>with regards to building and selling Ellipsis?

Honestly, it's hard to say. I think I would have considered working
with a publisher to maximize our marketing potential. We managed to
get featured on our own both on iOS and Android so it is possible to
achieve this as a small indie as long as you have a good game and you
are persistent. But I think a good mobile publisher would have been
able to multiply the amount of high profile reviews we could have
gotten.

Potentially going ad-based may have been a better idea from the start
but I still don't have enough data to fully justify it.

More than anything else, I would have tried to release Ellipsis
earlier. Still I'm not sure how we could have done it faster and kept
it to a high standard.

# Interview With Henry Smith - Spaceteam

My first time playing Spaceteam was during a lunch break. We got a
quick bite to eat and got on the topic of indie games. At which point,
he told me to download Spaceteam to play a quick round. Usually, when
a friend recommends a game to me (paid or free), I buy it. This game
was espcially easy to convice me of because it was free. I immediately
saw the "character/the developer's mark" as soon as I opened the
app. After hearing Spaceteam "theme" song, I was an instant fan of
anything Henry creates.

>How old are you? What's your professional and educational background?

I'm 37 years old. I've been designing games as a hobby since I was a
kid. First it was board games and card games. Then I started playing
with HyperCard on the family Mac Plus. I made and published my first
real shareware game at 15 (it was called "Squish"). Then I got a
Computer Science degree and worked in the AAA game industry, at
Irrational Games and BioWare, for about 10 years before going indie.

>What technologies/frameworks did you use to build Spaceteam?

The first version was iOS only and used the Cocos2d sprite engine and
native Objective-C code. I used the `CocoaAsyncSocket` and `HHServices`
libraries for networking.

Shortly afterwards it came to Android thanks to another company,
Apportable, using their custom technology to create an APK from the
iOS source code.

Now, many years later, I'm completely rebuilding the game in Unity
using C#. I'm using a bunch of libraries from the Asset Store. I'll
release a full list on my blog/website when the new version launches
in a few weeks.

>How long did it take to build?

The original iOS version took 3 months to build. But since then I've
spent the past 3+ years supporting the game, adding new features,
building a community, and creating spin-off projects.

The Unity rebuild is almost finished and took ~6 months to build. I
was learning Unity as I went and had to incorporate all the changes
and upgrades that the game has seen since it's initial release.

>How big is the code base (lines of code that you wrote)?

This is the first time I've counted them so this was interesting to
me!

Original game: 49k lines of Objective-C/C++

New Unity rebuild: 20k lines of C#

It's worth noting that this isn't an exact comparison because some
assets/data that were originally in code are now stored in other ways
in the Unity project.

>How much lifetime revenue (gross) has the game generated on iOS?

iOS In-App Purchase revenue: $38,131

However the game was also mostly responsible for:

- A successful fundraising campaign on Kickstarter ($83k)
- Prize money ($7k)
- Commissioned spin-off projects (~$22k)

>How much lifetime revenue (gross) has the game generated on Android?

Android In-App Purchase revenue: $18,836

Humble Bundle sales: $11k

>During the sale and development of Spaceteam, what was one of your
>happiest moments?

My happiest moments are interactions with fans:

- When I discovered the first piece of Spaceteam fan-fiction :-)
- Getting hugs and high-fives and autograph requests (!) from fans at festivals

>Your saddest moments?

My saddest times have actually been the last few months. For a long
time I was looking forward to moving on from Spaceteam to new games,
and the unexpected rebuild set me back longer than I wanted. It's also
pretty unmotivating to remake the the same game again. But the end is
in sight!

I also remember a particularly gut-wrenching moment. We were cleaning
up our exhibitor booth at PAX East in Boston and were told by a
passing stranger that Spaceteam was being used as the secret final
round of the Omegathon competition. It was being played live, as we
spoke, by two teams on stage in front of thousands of attendees. We
quickly opened a laptop and managed to get a livestream of the event,
only to see it start disconnecting again and again in the middle of
the game. It was painful to watch but also thrilling at the same time!

Luckily I think most people blamed the network conditions rather than
the game itself and the end result was pretty positive.

>What tips do you have for those that are just starting with
>programming and game development?

Start small and triple your estimates. Everything takes longer than
you think.

When I first quit my industry job I had stars in my eyes and wanted to
make an ambitious space-exploration game with a procedural world and
modular ships and interesting encounters and multiple ways to play (I
still want to make this game...)

But instead I forced myself to make a tiny practice project to learn
and grow from. That ended up being Spaceteam. It was the best decision
I ever made.

>We may have a couple of project managers reading this interview. Any
>tips for them with regards to managing a project/interacting with
>developers?

I'm not managing anyone now, but I did lead a small team at
BioWare. My advice shouldn't come as a surprise: give people as much
autonomy as you can, ask them what they want to be doing, prefer
positive feedback to criticism (even if you think it's constructive).

>Also, we may have a couple of ad men reading this interview. Any tips
>for them with regards to marketing a game?

I have no clue about marketing. I never did any paid advertising for
Spaceteam, just shared it with industry connections and on social
media. I also kept a development blog and entered some
competitions. It grew organically from there.

I did try various other things: cold-emails to press, reddit AMAs,
etc. but it's so hard to measure the effects of these things.

>You went with a free game with IAP (just wanted to say you've done it
>tastefully), any thoughts on this model vs premium? Why free and not
>paid?

From the beginning I had planned the game to be a free teaser project
to get my name out there. I had some savings and I never expected to
make any money with my first game. I added the "tip jar" IAP mostly as
a last-minute experiment so that people could support me if they
really liked the game.

But in retrospect free seems like the best model for a
multiplayer-only game like this. I think making four friends all pay
$1 just to try a weird new game would have severely hindered adoption
and growth.

I've always disliked ads and I was very sensitive to not being
exploitative with micro-transactions. I want to keep my next game free
as well if I can.

>Given hindsight is 20/20, would you have done anything differently
>with regards to building and selling Spaceteam?

Difficult question since Spaceteam was a much bigger success than I
expected and it's hard to tell which parts of its trajectory were
important to this. There are a couple of specific projects that I
probably would have said "no" to, but everything was so context
dependent that I'm not sure I learnt any lessons I can apply
elsewhere.

>Any "must do this or don't come crying to me" kind of stuff?

As a new indie it's so easy to be seduced by the idea that you can do
everything. Swallow your pride and start small.

# Interview With Ryan McLeod - Blackbox

I actually heard about Blackbox during an interview/podcast called
iPhreaks. At the end of the podcast we gave our "top picks". The
cohost talked about Blackbox and how awesome it was (word of mouth
recommendations are incredibly powerful, so don't underestimate
them). Additionally each connection you make is a long unforseen chain
of events that could lead to something important, so pursue
_everything_ if you can (especially at the beginning). For me it was:

- Having lunch with a friend who told me about an iOS Remote
  Conference that was looking for speakers.
- Me taking the time to submit a talk (it got accepted).
- Me giving a good presentation.
- The facilitator of the conference liking the presentation and
  inviting me to talk on his podcast (iPhreaks).
- Me saying yes and actually doing the podcast.
- Him recommending Blackbox on the podcast as one of his top picks.
- Me downloading it (and loving it).
- Me hunting down Ryan on Twitter and asking him if he wanted to be
  interviewed.
- Him being a good guy and saying yes. Remember what I said about
  pursuing every opportunity? He's doing that.
- 18+ email exchanges over 15 days.
- And here we are.

>How old are you? What's your professional and educational background?

I'm 25. I grew up loving computers, robotics, and design (I was pretty
convinced my destiny was to compete on Battle Bots). I got into web
design in high school and somehow landed an internship at a 50 person
web start-up. After high school I went to California Polytechnic San
Luis Obispo for a BS+MS in Computer Science. Low-level C and assembly
wasn't really my passion so I spent a lot of time goofing off trying
to gain design skills and learn more about user experience concepts on
the side. When our school offered a new iOS development class I was
one of the first people to sign up. I actually got to show my final
app in that class to Peter Oppenheimer (former CFO of Apple). After
that I interned at Apple and then Airbnb doing web work, but learned a
ton about design too. Once I graduated I tried my hand at a music
discovery start-up with some friends, consulted some start-ups, and
decided it was now-or-never to try to learn iOS and try creating this
idea of a "blackbox" game.

>What technologies/frameworks did you use to build Blackbox?

Hah, Blackbox is built almost entirely with native cocoa/UIViews and
is written in Objective-C (when I started Swift was still very
young). I didn't realize building a game with native views wasn't
normal until I got called crazy a few times. I think the naivety paid
off though. Blackbox is working creatively within constraints and if I
had used a proper framework like cocos2d or SpriteKit I think the game
would have lost a lot of its unique look and native feel. Beyond that
Blackbox relies on almost every sensor API the phone has to offer and
a dozen or so third party libraries to help me keep my sanity (I still
had to learn how to patch together a pitch detection algorithm
though). Along the way I've built a handful of mini-libraries that
have made Blackbox a lot easier to expand, including a modal card
library, a permission management system, and an interesting time
tracking (cheat-prevention) system. Would love to open source some
when/if things calm down.

>How long did it take to build?

A little over a year ...but I was also learning iOS/Objective-C along
the way. I've gotten a lot faster.

>How big is the code base (lines of code that you wrote)?

Excluding all 3rd party code and blank lines Blackbox is comprised of
35,730 lines spread over ~600 Objective-C files (half are headers of
course). An additional 7,333 lines are comments! I like comments. (The
entire binary would likely be less than 2MB but online speech
recognition makes the whole thing swell to around 45MB.)

>How much lifetime revenue (gross) has the game generated on iOS?

((((( After Apple's cut, right? revenue/profit/gross always trip me up
))))) $32,000 in the 5 months since launch February 25th, 2016. Keep
in mind that $15,000 of that was made in the first two weeks (Blackbox
was featured in Best New Games during the first week). Don't
underestimate the long tail.

>During the sale and development of Blackbox, what was one of your happiest moments?

It's hard to choose just one! I've wanted to become "an iOS developer"
since the App Store opened. There was a point amid the week long blur
of launching when I realized I had become exactly that—I was pretty
giddy.

Besides that, reading the reviews and talking to players has been
incredible. I'll never be able to really play the game and get the
same enjoyment from it as my players do so I get to live vicariously
and it's glorious. So many games have made strong impressions on me
over the years and now I get to do the same. Getting to hear all the
stories and see pictures of mountains players have climbed, planes
they've flown, perfect pitch they've sung, or crazy weather balloon
purchase they've almost made all to solve Blackbox challenges is
always moving. One woman messaged me from the side of a mountain; she
had just ran out the door to drive up in the rain–to the confusion of
her husband–so she could "fill in this last little unfilled box."

The game's voice is my voice and I try to be pretty accessible to my
players; those who get far enough in the game get a direct line to me
too :) It can be overwhelming but it provides constant motivation to
get back to work!

>Your saddest moments?

Probably when people started trying to scam me. It was the first week
and this one person came up with an elaborate story of how they had
dropped their phone in a pond and the insurance company just replaced
it and could I please unlock the paid levels for free. I asked when
she had bought it and she said a week or so ago; the game had launched
a day earlier. I called her out and we had a funny chat, but that
happened A LOT. Sometimes I'd try to explain that without charging a
dollar and change I'd have to put ads in or charge for the app upfront
and people would get mad! Some people still suggest in the reviews
from time to time that I add ads. I refuse.

I wanted as many people as possible to be able to enjoy Blackbox for
free and pay for a small percentage of extra levels if they were
really into the game and wanted to support it. The lengths people will
go to to save $1.99 was really disheartening, especially when I see
players who've completed every level EXCEPT the paid ones. I know
they'd enjoy them, but...

>What tips do you have for those that are just starting with
>programming and game development?

Do not move fast and break things. Some features might need to scoped
down, you may need to stop yourself from "gold-plating", or avoid
over-eager optimization, but don't pass up opportunities to learn and
to do it right. I think I'm a pretty slow programmer, but that's in
part because when I run into something I don't understand, or feel
"there has got to be a better way", I generally stop, go online, read
up, talk to a friend, and try to learn how to do it right. It's a
great way to build your skill-set while developing not to mention
you'll end up with a more solid codebase that you don't abhor
maintaining.

>We may have a couple of project managers reading this interview. Any
>tips for them with regards to managing a project/interacting with
>developers?

Hard to say... Blackbox never had a solid schedule and my meandering
direction and focus led to some of the most cherished parts of the
game. At a scale requiring project management, it's probably important
to let some wandering happen while keeping a finger on what
matters. When it comes down to it, there are always things worth
cutting or skipping but always step back and choose based on what the
player will notice and care about; analytics can be your barometers
but never let them be compasses.

Don't underestimate finesse. The extra day or two (or three) it takes
to add a gesture based transition or a downpour of confetti may not
seem worthwhile but it's the subtle things that sometimes create
guttural pleasure and attachment between player and game. That said
don't overestimate finesse either—just because the details are
beautiful or unique doesn't mean the game will be a success. The core
game has to be intriguing and fun, after that it's the details that
will make it beloved.

>Also, we may have a couple of ad men reading this interview. Any tips
>for them with regards to marketing a game (your in game advertising
>techniques are phenomenal btw)?

Thank you! Most smartphone users download an average of 0 apps a
month. Those that are downloading new apps are strongly influenced by
word of mouth so enabling and exciting your players to help you and
themselves by sharing your app is incredibly important! As an indie
you can't bank on broadcast methods so standing out and being creative
is key.

In Blackbox there are many ways to share screenshots of your
progress. Players that successfully refer a friend are rewarded with a
free hint and thanked (with trademark Blackbox snark). If they open
the sharing dialog and cancel I let them know that if they ever change
their mind in the future there's a new challenge waiting for
them. There's even some fun sass if I catch you trying to cheat the
sharing system. The placeholder share text is also tailored to each
sharing platform to be as easy as possible to blast off to friends and
not feel spammy. I try to make sure sharing or following never seems
forced or punitive, and instead try really hard to make it desired and
fun. Part of this involved letting the game's voice be my own instead
of a brand, which helped set apart the game, connects players, and
seems to make them more forgiving.

In addition to explicit and obvious sharing mechanics, parts of the
game are designed as more subtle conversational pieces. Did I really
need to add a fourth distance challenge that's 1000km away? Lol. Do
people talk about it a lot? Definitely.

>You went with a free game with IAP (just wanted to say you've done it
>tastefully), any thoughts on this model vs premium? Why free and not
>paid?

I've always been a premium advocate, but then I realized how
influential shareware/demo software was to me growing up: I must have
played the Starcraft demo campaign a hundred times over; I used
Sublime unpaid for years; I don't need to say anything about
Photoshop. I wanted as many people as possible to be able to play
Blackbox while still letting the people that love supporting good
software chip in without it feeling like charity. Freemium comes in a
dozen different colors and I've changed course over the years and
realized not all forms are bad. I also wanted it to be easy for people
to get their friends to download the game. How often do you get a
recommendation for an app but you hesitate downloading it because it
isn't free? I wanted to make downloading it a no-brainer, especially
since Blackbox is hard to explain without spoiling it! I needed to get
people in the door as soon as they were intrigued and not a minute
later. Could I be making more daily with a paid app? Maybe—but it
hurts me to imagine the number of people who would never get to enjoy
any of it. I on a bit of a mission to show that IAP can be done well
and be sustainable even without using ads for non-paying players.

>Given hindsight is 20/20, would you have done anything differently
>with regards to building and selling Blackbox?

I think things went pretty well. There isn't much I would change but I
definitely wish I had spent less time on certain things like a solar
path that is accurate to your location on the globe—that took way too
long and I don't think anyone has noticed except for those on the
equator that get to experience an interesting graphing bug.

>Any "must do this or don't come crying to me" kind of stuff?

Test your game, then swallow your hubris and listen—really
listen. Blackbox was continuously in beta for a year. Originally I
just shared with friends, but the group grew to over 500 people by
launch. Email feedback was okay but it came with the formal
intimidation of email. I eventually built in a great chat system using
smooch.io, this made giving and getting feedback so seamless that I
could hear everything. Sometimes you don't want to hear everything,
but you have to hear everything. Sometimes feedback feels mean, it
goes against your sensibilities, your design, what you wanted. When
two people have trouble with the same thing, it's likely not their
fault, it is yours. That doesn't mean you take every suggestion you're
presented with, you must differentiate between what's immediately
important and what are good ideas to hold onto and consider, but don't
be hurt; be thankful, iterate, and test again. Follow up, ask
questions, thank, and make your testers feel appreciated and
comfortable. It'll pay off in multitudes.

# Interview With Ed Biden - Head of State

A Dark Room iOS's twitter, an _active, genuine_ indie dev,
plus
[this Gamasutra article](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/EdBiden/20160912/281109/How_Head_of_State_went_from_Passion_Project_to_Top10_Download.php) led
to this interview. Head of State is simply a great _evil_ time. The
tutorial is welcoming, the art is great unique, the music is great
too, and I got a strong sense of cognitive dissonance when playing (any
game that evokes emotion is a great game in my book).

>How old are you? What's your professional and educational background?

I'm 34. I grew up in the UK, studied Human Sciences at Oxford then
worked in a range of industries from venture capital to running a soft
drinks brand before ending up in the games industry. I spent a year in
Paris making Facebook games and then 3 years in Berlin making mobile
games (both as a product lead rather than a developer) before leaving
to work in e-commerce, learning to code and making Head of State.

>What technologies/frameworks did you use to build Head of State?

Unity, coding the scripts in C# and bug fixing where necessary and as
little as possible in XCode (... I hate it SO much).

>Head of State had me dealing with a lot of cognitive dissonance
>(nothing ever felt black and white with my choices). How have players
>responded to this?

Some players have found the choices you make to be ambiguous or to
have too little feedback. This was partly a conscious design choice -
when we added more feedback the game seemed far to complicated, so we
toned it back a bit.

Others agonised over every decision, as they were forced to choose
policies they would never endorse in real life in order to win. This
was definitely by design, because we wanted people to think about the
process of entering a democratic election as a candidate, and what you
might be prepared to sacrifice and compromise on to win.

>How long did it take to build Head of State?

About 8 months, coding 10-15 hours a week, having done very little
coding before (so a LOT of refactoring, debugging and getting
stuck). Head of State is perhaps 80% of the coding I've ever done. I
had help from a writer and an artist too which helped immensely, not
only by providing assets and content, but having collaborators to
bounce ideas off and hold me accountable to self imposed deadlines.

>How big is the code base?

About 20k lines of code.

>How much lifetime revenue (gross) has the game generated on iOS? On Android?

The game has been live on both platforms for 18 days now.

On iOS we got featured on the homepage in 83 countries (#15 or #16 in
New Games we Love), so far we've made $27k revenue, $17k proceeds,
14.9k downloads. At the moment we're getting about 100 downloads a
day.

On Android you couldn't even find our game in the Play Store the day
it launched. So far we've made just under 500 EUR (revenue), 320 EUR
proceeds. We get 3-5 downloads a day there at the moment.

>During the sale and development of Head of State, what was one of
>your happiest moments?

Seeing Head of State climb to #5 paid game in the UK - you could see
it above the fold in the charts. I was ecstatic, and it didn't feel
quite real. I kept checking the charts every hour or two to see if we
moved and whether we would keep climbing. I knew from making games
professionally how difficult that was. To do it on a first game was
incredibly lucky.

>Your saddest moments?

Not being able to find the game on Google Play as we were featured in
the App Store was incredibly frustrating. The game was there, people
could download it if they had the link, but if you searched for the
name it didn't show up in the first page of results... given the effort
I'd put in to making the Android version work, making the game
playable on variable screen sizes and coordinating a simultaneous
launch on both iOS and Android it was a real kick in the teeth.

My frustrations with iOS were equal at other points in the process. I
lost two days at one point updating first my iOS, the Mac OS, then
XCode and finally Unity to make sure everything was up to date and
played nicely with each other. Unbelievably painful.

>What tips do you have for those that are just starting with
>programming and game development?

Get something on your phone within a day (there are tutorials that
will take you from literally zero coding ability to something on your
phone in four hours, including downloading all the software you need,
which is free). Then build and experiment from there. There's nothing
quite like people asking what you are up to, and whipping out your
phone and showing them a game they can actually play. The reactions
you get, especially if they don't think you can code, give you the
motivation to keep plugging away. You want to have something new to
show them next time you see them.

>We may have a couple of project managers reading this interview. Any
>tips for them with regards to managing a project/interacting with
>developers?

Developers are craftsmen, artisans who work in code. Make them feel
that way. Get them to take pride in their work and create something
that is elegant, functional and delightful for their users. Make sure
they understand the problem you are trying to solve and suggest
answers. They will probably be able to come up with better solutions
than you can.

>Also, we may have a couple of ad men reading this interview. Any tips
>for them with regards to marketing a game?

All the PR I did myself and it went ok (an interview and pre-launch
press on the major mobile blogs; a few non English reviews after
launch). It's just a case of being disciplined:

- Read the advice on writing a press release
- Get it out 2-3 weeks before launch
- Write every email with a personal intro
- Write hundreds of emails
- Follow up once or twice per journalist

But the best and most fun marketing thing I did was write the blog
for Gamasutra about how the game went from a passion project to a top
5 downloaded game. We think this is the reason that the game went from
#200 to #36 in the US charts the week after the launch. People love a
story. I wouldn't start working on a new game without working out the
story I'd write for the launch press now.

>You went for a premium game as opposed to a game that was free with
>IAP. Why?

Well, originally we were going to release the game for free, more or
less as a political statement. The further we got into development,
the higher the quality got. Eventually I realised that we would be
very justified charging for it given both the quality of the game, and
the time we were putting into it.

So we never really thought about the commercial strategy from the
start, just decided to flip from free to premium.

But IAP typically requires a LOT of content. Players chew through
content incredibly fast - I knew this from my time working in F2P
professionally. I wanted something manageable, but also finite. I
wanted to code the game and then be able to leave it and move onto
other games / projects rather than have it hanging over me
indefinitely. I guess I could have done a free mode with IAP to unlock
more game modes etc. but that felt too complicated.

>Given hindsight is 20/20, would you have done anything differently
>with regards to building and selling Head of State?

Not much to be honest. It went a lot better than I ever dared
imagine. I would have started coding earlier though, and just got on
with it. I would have loved to start in June 2015 and launched in
March 2016. With the Brexit referendum and US presidential elections
2016 is the year to be launching political games...

>Any other tips? EG: Any "must do this or don't come crying to me"
>kind of stuff?

- Start the project, don't just talk about it.
- Work out what you are doing that is actually different from everyone
  else. (i.e. what is the launch PR?).
- Finish the project. Ship something.

# Interview With Kepa Auwae - Wayward Souls

Wayward Souls is a "true to the genre" rougelike. The music, controls,
graphics all bring back so many nostalgic memories of being a kid and
playing a great hack and slash RPG. Wayward Souls was competing for
the top charts around the same time as ADR. It was one of the few
games I felt were honorable (not your run of the mill novel/casual iOS
game). The Rocketcat Games studio has both premium and free + IAP
games (a lot like Philipp Stollenmayer).

>Mind telling us a little bit about yourself and the team?
>Specifically age, professional, and educational background?

I was a pediatric nurse about 8 years ago. I decided to be a game
developer one night. It was pretty arbitrary. I was 25 at the time. I
made a team with a couple of friends, who were also game devs.

We got into iOS fairly early, but missed the "gold rush" by a little
bit. The gold rush being when there weren't many games on the App
Store, so there were lots of big hits. Our first game still made
enough where we could go part time on our main jobs, and our second
game did well enough to go full time.

>With regards to Wayward Souls, Punch Quest, and Five Card Quest, what
>technologies/languages did you use to build the games? How large are
>the code bases? How long did they take you to make?

All custom engines. Usually a year or so of tech per game, then the
rest of the design follows. Then further games reuse the same engine,
usually with another year of tech development.

>I like to be as transparent as possible with revenue, if that's
>something you can share, that would be awesome. What's the life time
>revenue for Punch Quest, Five Card Quest, and Wayward Souls?

Wayward made over 500k (vague number), the others made roughly half.

>Between iOS and Android, which platform has brought in the most
>revenue? Percentage breakdown?

iOS makes the most. I think Android accounts to maybe 30%.

>What were some of the happiest moments during the development of your
>games?

Well, lots of happy moments. Pretty much when any game succeeds and
gets a lot of critical and fan success. We've been really lucky.

>The saddest moments?

The first game was the worst because we had no guarantee at all that
it would be successful. We also had very harsh hours, because we were
working on it with our limited spare time. Just wasting weekends on
it. Easily could have given up during the development, but we didn't.

>What tips do you have for those that are just starting with
>programming and game development?

Save up money before going off on your own. That or do contract work.

>We may have a couple of project managers reading this interview. Any
>tips for them with regards to managing a project/interacting with
>developers?

For me it's kind of dumb luck stumbling onto a team that are very
independent and don't need to be closely watched. It's very important
to get the right people on the team. As for knowing who the right
people are instead of just stumbling onto them, I think that takes
experience.

>Also, we may have a couple of ad men reading this interview. Any tips
>for them with regards to marketing a game?

We always used the Toucharcade forums for mobile games. Especially the
Upcoming Games Thread. The fans of the site read the forums. The
reviewers on the site check the forums to see what the fans are
responding to. I can't prove it, but I've always thought that Apple
reads Toucharcade and the other major mobile sites.

>Between Wayward Souls, Five Card Quest, and Punch Quest, you have
>games that are both premium and free to play with IAP. Do you have
>any insight with regards to when to choose premium vs free to play?

I'll go free-to-play if I'm designing an extremely mass market
game. Punch Quest, our free game, probably wasn't even mass market
enough to justify being free. You have to design your free to play
game for the biggest audience possible, which means the most general
mass market appeal possible. I'm thinking a game played with one
finger or thumb is the ideal, especially ones that don't require
finger dexterity. I think games like Temple Run started a trend of
showing that arcade-style games with some finger dexterity can work,
if they're still based around very simple controls. But something that
doesn't require dexterity generally is safer for the "mass market"
idea.

Otherwise I'd just go paid. All my games except Punch Quest are
paid. I've been hearing bad things about paid recently, though soon
I'll see how things are there for myself once we launch Death Road to
Canada.

>I think it was really cool that you released an early version of
>Wayward Souls, and told people that with every iOS update, you'd
>raise the price. How did the incremental development and pricing
>strategy work out for you?

It wasn't even really an early version. It was the full game, minus
some extra stuff we had planned before the launch but didn't
necessarily plan to get in for the release. We'd add tweaks based on
feedback, along with major content updates like all new areas.

It worked very well. Every update was a warning to get the game before
the price increase. The steady price increase as an
"anti-sale"... instead of people waiting for the game to go on
discount, they'd actually get it. And the game never went on sale,
either.

>Given hindsight is 20/20, would you have done anything differently
>with regards to building and selling your games?

I'd maybe have tried to get on PC about a year earlier.

>Your games have been featured a number of times with Apple, any tips
>with regards to getting featured by Apple?

They've known I've made games for years now. Getting covered by major
sites can help a lot there.

>Any other tips with regards to getting featured by Apple? Any "must
>do this or don't come crying to me" kind of stuff?

Post on the Toucharcade "Upcoming Games" forums.

# Interview With Reilly and Joe - Warbits

How awesome is that? Having the chance to interview the indie shop
that created Warbits (a game that was recently had a _top banner
Editors Choice_ feature in the App Store). What's cooler is that they
are right in my backyard (Dallas, TX). I hope you have a lot of good
takeaways from this interview. **It's important to get out and about
in your local development community**. I was connected to these guys
because I was a regular speaker at a local app developer group. Nick
(the facilitator of the group) knew I was writing a book and connected
me with Reilly and Joe. If I wasn't a regular at the group, I probably
would have never gotten this interview.

With regards to Reilly and Joe, they didn't quit their day job while
building their game (I don't recommend rage quitting Corporate America
and selling all of your worldly possesions like I did).

>How old are you? What's your professional and educational background?

Reilly:

I'm 30 years old. I studied visual communication design at UTA
and currently work in the apparel industry.

Joe:

I'm 30 years old. I attended college for 2 years, but took an
extended break when I landed a job with a bank I interned at. No
formal education in computer science, but I would love to go back
someday. I currently work as a business intelligence analyst at my day
job.

>What technologies/frameworks did you use to build Warbits?

Reilly:

Being the art/design side of things I mainly used Adobe
Illustrator with some Photoshop sprinkled in.

Joe:

Warbits is written in Objective-C using the Cocos2d engine. Our
day to day workflow revolved around Dropbox, Trello, Git and Google
Hangouts.

>Warbits reminds me of Daisenryaku. I loved that game and spent many
>many hours playing with friends on a modded XBOX. Not a question, but
>comments welcome!

Reilly:

Hah, I've never even heard of this game! Warbits was actually
a homage to Intelligent System's fantastic Wars series, specifically
Advance Wars for the Game Boy Advance. After reading up on
Daisenryaku's history it looks like it first launched in 1988, just a
couple months after Famicom Wars was released. I'll have to give it a
try.

Joe:

I was introduced to Advance Wars by Reilly and quickly fell in
love. I've always been a fan of strategy games and a turn-based game
sounded like a gentle introduction to game development. I was wrong,
it wasn't gentle.

>How long did it take to build Warbits?

Reilly:

4 very long years. Though we had never worked on a game before
and kept our full time jobs during the entire development.

>How big is the code base?

Joe:

45k lines of code. 1,215 commits.

>How much lifetime revenue (gross) has the game generated on iOS?

Reilly:

At the moment Warbits has sold almost 60k units grossing
roughly $180k.

>During the sale and development of Warbits, what was one of your
>happiest moments?

Joe:

Driving home from breakfast with my family and having to pull
over to the side of the rode when Reilly broke the news about our
editors choice award. Getting into the groove of game development and
tinkering away night after night, feeling productive and optimistic.

>Your saddest moments?

Joe:

Moments of doubt and impostor syndrome. Wasted money on flaky
contractors. Going to bed before I fixed that really annoying bug.

>What tips do you have for those that are just starting with
>programming and game development?

Joe:

Start small and fully publish a game. You'll learn lessons by
going through the motions that will be more valuable when the stakes
are higher.

>We may have a couple of project managers reading this
>interview. Any tips for them with regards to managing a
>project/interacting with developers?

Reilly:

I think one of the most important things is to know when to
cut something. We spent countless hours talking in circles about
features that never shipped.

>Also, we may have a couple of ad men reading this interview. Any
>tips for them with regards to marketing a game?

Reilly:

We're no experts at marketing, I think that's what many indie
teams struggle with the most. We mainly stuck to Twitter and Facebook
as well as staying active on some forums such as TouchArcade. Engaging
the community is one of the best way to gain fans that will turn
around and promote your game for you.

>You went for a premium game as opposed to a game that was free with
>IAP. Why?

Joe:

We liked the straightforward nature of offering a quality game
for an honest price. It felt right to present our first game as a
premium offering, especially for the Advance Wars crowd eagerly
awaiting a comparable game. We also could afford to do it, since this
was a part-time project for us. The wide reach of a freemium game is a
much safer bet for a full time studio trying to keep the lights on.

Reilly:

Free to Play games are a relatively new concept and take a lot
more careful consideration to execute properly. On the flip side,
we've been playing premium games our entire lives so the checklist was
much more straight forward.

>Given hindsight is 20/20, would you have done anything differently
>with regards to building and selling Warbits?

Joe:

In hindsight I regret not building the game in Unity, but 4 years
ago cocos2d was a very popular and well documented engine.

>You are one of the few people that I know of that have been featured
>by Apple's Editors Choice. This is a big freaking deal. How many
>downloads did you get during that time period. Did it help your
>premium sales after you went back to paid?

Reilly:

During our two week feature we sold around 46k units. Now with
the feature over we sell about 1,000 units a month. Having editors
choice also means you're more likely to be pulled into other small
promotions which helps a lot.

>Any other tips with regards to getting featured by Apple? Any "must
>do this or don't come crying to me" kind of stuff?

Joe:

Focus on the factors you can control. Nothing wrong with wheeling
and dealing, but the biggest variable you can influence is your
game. Pick something you're passionate about, execute and present it
well.

Reilly:

Don't expect a response from anyone. The only contact we
received before our feature was an automated email from iTunes Connect
asking for promotional artwork. We had no idea what was going to
happen.

# Interview With Devine Lu Linvega - Some Unique Games I Can't Pronounce

I reached out to Devine after my interview with Chris Charlton from
Kaiju Pop (and his recommenation of Devine's work). I downloaded all
his games. His unique style was extremely compelling, I had to
know who this dev was. Guys and gals, visit his site, read what he's
written about. There is a lots of wisdom around "stuff not related to
games" that can't be justly captured in this interview.

Aside: when you're a small time dev. Follow every recommended lead
(if someone you trusts tells you to check something out, do
it... every small bit helps, and you never know where the interaction
will take you).

>Mind telling us a little bit about yourself?

I am Devine Lu Linvega, I live on a sailboat somewhere on the shores
of the Pacific Ocean, spending my days picking fights on Wikipedia's
talk pages, moderating the linguistic portals of StackExchange - and
sometimes [making games](http://100r.co/). I have no professional background, and no
schooling. For information about my life on a sailboat, [go here](http://100r.co/).

>With regards to Oquonie, Hiversaries, Ledoliel, and Donsol, what
>technologies/languages did you use to build the games? How large are
>the code bases? How long did they take you to make?

All of these projects use similar technologies. Oquonie was the only
project migrated onto Swift, the other, Objective C. My earlier
projects like Hiversaires and Ledoliel were not even using Objected
Oriented structure, and were instead, based on a single massive class
named Game. [Oquonie took me almost 500 hours, with all 3, or 4, ports
and migrations](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/oquonie:horaire). Hiversaires
took me about 3 months and the others, just a few days. Donsol was
made during Train Jam, and had it's first version completed under 24
hours.

>My favorite out of all of them is Ledoliel. Just a comment. I cracked
>up so many times playing that game.

Ledoliel was born out of a tweet in reply to something by Christine
Love, I cannot remember.

>What's the life time revenue for your games?

I have made about 30K per year from iOS sales since I started.

>What were some of the happiest moments during the development of your
>games?

The Swift Language release.

>The saddest moments?

The XCode 11 release.

>What tips do you have for those that are just starting with
>programming and game development?

Make the games you want to play. Make them in less than a year.

>We may have a couple of project managers reading this interview. Any
>tips for them with regards to managing a project/interacting with
>developers?

I have absolutely no idea, I am unmanageable.

>Also, we may have a couple of ad men reading this interview. Any tips
>for them with regards to marketing a game?

No clue, I never looked into advertisement. I never download games or
apps with ads in them, they ruin the experience for me.

>You went with premium for all of you games. Any reasoning behind
>this? You are also the first person I've interviewed that has done
>app bundles. Is that working out for you?

App bundles are fun, they can encapsule a message that lives across
multiple apps. And regarding ads, like I have previously said, I don't
think that any of my app would be enhanced with a loud colourful
banner that tries to upsell star wars underwear from Thinkgeek.

>I think it was really cool that some of your stuff is open source
>(and that you've kept a developer log). What was the motivation
>behind that?

It was really helpful for me to learn from other developer's open
source code. I am hoping that I can help others in return.

>Given hindsight is 20/20, would you have done anything differently
>with regards to building and selling your games?

I would not have done iOS specifically if I had known that the
developer tools were to keep on worsening. I would have focused on
making games using web technologies instead.

>Any other tips? EG: Any "must do this or don't come crying to me" kind of stuff?

Use version control, track your time, work open source, fuck ads.

# Interview With Justin Smith - Desert Golfing

I played this game way too much. Desert Golfing is a true testimate how
building with constraints in design can acomplish (that plus you don't
need to be an amazing artist to make a successful game).

>How old are you? What's your professional and educational background?

I'm 39. I graduated with a degree in computer science in 1998 and
immediately got a job in triple-A games. I worked for about 9 years
before going semi-indie. Being semi-indie means I split my time about
50/50 between working for small studios and working independently.

>What technologies/frameworks did you use to build Desert Golfing?

Desert Golfing was made with my own C++ game engine. I call it the
Crusty engine. It started life as something I downloaded off the
Internet called Haff's Game Engine. I added OpenGL, Box2D physics, iOS
and Android code, and lots of other stuff, all held together with
bubble gum.

>The physics in Desert Golfing are so nice. The game as a whole is
>almost peaceful (I'm on hole 4494 by the way). How did you go about
>perfecting how the game "feels"?

Desert Golfing is about the 20th game I've made with Box2d
physics. Practise! I'm getting good at knowing all the right friction,
density, impulse, and dampening parameters I need to get the feel I
want. Little things are also very important, like how the ball sinks
into the sand, and how the platform rises so satisfyingly. I sensed
early on that Desert Golfing was developing a very zen like feel, so I
made sure not to add anything that would ruin it like flashy effects
and juice.

>How long did it take to build Desert Golfing?

It took 2 solid weeks of dedicated don't-bug-me-I'm-coding coding,
plus about a month of more casual testing, tweaking, bug fixing, and
porting.

>How big is the code base?

About 4500 lines of code that I personally wrote (engine code plus
golf code), not including library code.

>How much lifetime revenue (gross) has the game generated on iOS? On
>Android?

I little over 100k on iOS and half that on Android. I'm really happy
that Android is genuinely worth it now. I was also really happy how
the Canadian Dollar tanked at the perfect time.

>During the sale and development of Desert Golfing, what was one of
>your happiest moments?

Seeing how obsessed people got with the cactus. It's just what I was
hoping for. And the gradual palette transformation. Someone made giant
grid of two thousand holes all pasted together and it looks really
lovely.

>Your saddest moments?

This is an easy one. All the Android bugs. There's still something
critically wrong with my save/load code that causes the ball to get
stuck inside the terrain occasionally.

>What tips do you have for those that are just starting with
>programming and game development?

This will seem at odds with "the saddest moment question", but my answer
is to embrace awful code. Your game just needs to get out the
door. There's a tendency to look for the best, most elegant way to
solve a problem. Most of the time that elegant solution has just as
many unknown problems as your naive solution. You're trading a bunch
of problems you know about for a bunch of problems you don't know
about. And sometimes trading simplicity for complexity.

>Also, we may have a couple of ad men reading this interview. Any tips
>for them with regards to marketing a game?

I don't have tips for ad men, but for other indie devs who are
clueless about marketing, my one tip is this: find interesting stories
about your game, or failing that, invent them. If you get asked a
question and the truth is boring, make something up, stretch the
facts. You're in the entertainment business.

>You went for a premium game as opposed to a game that was free with
>IAP. Why?

Be the change that you want to see in the world. I personally hate
looking at ads, and I hate games with micro transactions. I do like
the idea of a one-time IAP to unlock levels in a game, but the
minimalist aesthetic of Desert Golfing forbade it.

>Given hindsight is 20/20, would you have done anything differently
>with regards to building and selling Desert Golfing?

I would have thought more about an ending. I had no idea people would
want to play 10000+ holes. Originally the game ended at around hole
3000 with an infinitely long flat desert. I did an update to make the
game keep going until an impossible hole was generated. But this only
switched things from one anti-climactic ending to another. With
regards to selling the game, I should have tried to get it on Steam.

>Any other tips? EG: Any "must do this or don't come crying to me" kind of stuff?

This is Justin's secret miracle tip: Have a line of code in your game
that looks like this: `if Random(10000)==0 { do fun stuff }`. Games are
about systems, but often the idiosyncrasies are what people remember.

# Interview With Chris Charlton - Kaiju Pop

Chris and Kaiju Pop hold a special place in my heart. He was the very
first reviewer that felt A Dark Room was worthy enough for a
[video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W8MFBqgJKE). What's
absolutely insane is that the video review came out only a couple of
weeks after the games launch (unsolicited).

As an indie game developer, these are the small wins you have to look
for. It's these little things that keep you going. Take some time to
watch Chris's other video reviews. He _really_ does care about this craft.

>How old are you? What's your professional and educational background?

I'm 32, I live in Yokohama where I'm an elementary school teacher. I
have two young children. I also podcast and write about Japanese pro
wrestling, [including in my 2015 book](https://www.amazon.com/Lions-Pride-Turbulent-History-Wrestling/dp/4990865812).

>Want to share any history/background with regards to Kaiju Pop?

Kaiju Pop sprung from a community for expat gamers living in Japan
called gaijingamers. In the early 360/PS3 days it was essentially a
pair of lists to say which 360 games were region free (some weren't)
and which Japanese retail releases had English language support. It
then grew to encompass general gaming thoughts, a trading marketplace
and threads about Japanese life.

A few of us thought it would be neat for GG to have an editorial arm,
and that became where does godzilla poop? in 2012 (the name wasn't my
idea). The site outgrew the forum, and after typical message board
drama and a name change, Kaiju Pop was Kaiju Pop.

>There will be a lot of indie devs reading this. With regards to
>contacting editors/reviewers to get a game reviewed, what's the
>absolute worst thing for a dev to do/get him on your instant ban
>list?

We don't and wouldn't deny anybody coverage on any kind of principle
unless you're making something ludicrously hateful. What any dev
should realize though is that unless you're talking to a lucky (very)
few, it's unlikely your game would get covered for someone's job. If
you're sending press releases or review code unsolicited, that's a
great idea but you have to bear in mind it'd fall low on the list of
priorities, especially if it doesn't leap out as anything different or
interesting.

>There will be a lot of indie devs reading this. With regards to
>contacting editors/reviewers to get a game reviewed, what's the
>absolute best thing for a dev to do/get him in your graces?

We're all people, and all enjoy having our egos stroked. It's nice to
know a dev's looked at the site before getting in touch, and if
feedback we give seems honestly appreciated and taken aboard, it makes
the site seem worth doing, and makes us want to cover the next thing
you do.

>Got a funny story about an interaction you've had with regards to an
>editorial you've published (and the game devs involved)?

Being an old Amiga nerd, I was a huge fan of Gravity Force 2, a
multiplayer space dogfighting game. Around the 20th anniversary of
GF2, I tried to get in touch with the two guys that made it. One was
Jens Andersson, who as it turns out has a namesake who worked on The
Darkness among others. This Jens mistakenly had GF2 on his Mobygames
credits so there was some confusion when I asked him for an
interview. As it happened though, the other Jens was a big GF fan as
well. When I finally found the actual devs I managed to forge a
friendship between two Swedish game vets.

The other nice thing about that was these two guys Jan and Jens only
made a couple of these games as students and went on to 'proper'
jobs. The retrospective we ran and the response to it inspired them to
make a new GF, gravity force 20 on iOS Android and PC.

>What are your thoughts on premium games vs free with IAP? Why is it so
>hard for consumers to fork over $3.99 (or any amount of income) for a
>premium game? Have we just become numb to ads and energy bars?

There've been tons of think pieces going back as far as the start of
the App Store about the race to the bottom potentially killing the
space. Broadly speaking they turned out to be on the money. There was
a brief period in 2011-2013 when a lot of interesting people were
making a lot of interesting games for very cheap indeed, and that was
great. At the same time though it created a lot of entitlement, and
the frequent ridiculous anger of '5 Dollars? No game is worth that!'.

So the bottom fell out, (and piracy was a factor on Android) in a very
similar way to the mid 80s home computer scene in the UK. Of course
free to play was the last step in that race to the bottom. There are
many more millions of phones out there than consoles, and most people
playing games on them aren't gamers in the traditional sense. I like
music, but I never sit down and listen to it, and if I have headphones
in my ears, it's to listen to podcasts. So I haven't bought any music
for a few years, even then to support a friend's band. It's the same
for a lot of mobile game players I think.

So then visibility became a big problem, and then a lot of those
really interesting people went elsewhere. Six, seven years ago, mobile
game was a derisory label, and I think a lot took that as a challenge,
to show that an emotional connection was platform agnostic. That might
have been proven, but the people that took that challenge then had to
admit it wasn't financially viable for them.

>I'm starting to release unfinished games and then iterate on them
>publicly (A Noble Circle, which you have personal experience with
>throughout its progression). The first couple of months, the game is
>free, and then I start charging for it after it's more
>playable. Believe it or not, it's working! Am I insane? How would
>this affect editorials and reviews?

Similar models have had success in the PC space as well, although the
early access model has been exploited by some. Starting free gives
people a no risk chance to be on the ground floor and those early
adopters can vouch for the game when it's paid.

The issue, especially for indies might be in coverage. Even big sites
haven't really settled on a way to cover the more fluid and public
nature of game dev we have now so there'll be questions of how best to
cover a game. For sites stretched for time looking at a low profile
title that may turn a review into a brief video, a podcast mention or
a news piece. The upshot to that is you have writers in 'preview mode'
so to speak, and most coverage will be neutral or positive - flaws will
be 'things we hope they work on' not unforgivable travesties.

>What do you think the future of mobile gaming holds for indie game
>devs? Doom and gloom? Bright future?

It's not looking good. The proponents of premium material, on the
consumer and dev end have left or are leaving, either due to finances
or just the dev environment
([Aliceffekt](http://www.creativeapplications.net/openframeworks/experimental-mobile-apps-by-devine-aliceffect-lu-linvega/)
made his last iOS game after four years, saying he'd expected the
tools to get better and they just didn't) and even if you want in on
the free to play space (don't get me wrong, there's great free games
too, from Crossy Road to Tomb of the Mask) it's a very tough thing to
make money on.

Yet there are millions of 3DSes out there, and as much as it failed,
millions of Vitas too. There is a demand for paid content that's
handheld. How the NX does remains to be seen, but I'd say there is a
market, it's just incredibly hard to reach at this point.

>How can game devs better support editors/reviewers (and more
>specifically Kaiju Pop)?

As soon as we get into talk of support it all goes into gross
discussion of editorial autonomy. I read about Touch Arcade's issues
and their subsequent sticky wicket with their Patreon with
interest. The fact is that games editorial is largely dead as a thing
you can make money on, and most, us included just want it to keep
going as a means to get thoughts out there and because we like talking
about games as much as playing them. For us then, it's just a matter
of being open with review codes and interview requests. That's pretty
straightforward, but any more than that and you're going into murky
waters.

>Is Japan everything you dreamed of it to be? If I go there, will
>people high five me for wearing DBZ and Evangelion tshirts?

No, you geek. ;) I joke that when I came I was drawn to video games
and wrestling, and arrived at the nadir or pro wrestling in Japan, and
right at the end of the PS2's life which was arguably Japanese
gaming's last really big hoorah. Japan is home. Like the UK and the US
there are genuinely frightening elements in high positions of power
that make me worry about the world my kids will grow up in, but home
is where the angst is. Love it warts and all.

>What are your thoughts on the wrestling scene in Japan?

Wrestling is in a tricky transitionary phase right now here. It's
pulled out of a long slump, but now the business has to consider
growth in a very tricky world market dominated by wwe. It's similar to
the Japanese game space ten years ago, in that there's a risk of Japan
appealing to the western world by trying to adopt sports entertainment
tropes. We need more wrestling Dark Souls and no wrestling Lost Planet
3s.

# Interview With Shaun Musgrave - TouchArcade

My first interaction with TouchArcade was when I received an email
from one of their forum users about A Dark Room. He simply wanted to
say that he loved the game, and thanked me for making it. After
visting the website, I was an instant fan.

My first interaction with Shaun was via Twitter. He did a review of
Blek when it hit the #1 spot and unseated A Dark Room on day 19 of its
rank streak. After the interview went out about Blek, I immediately
whined to him like a baby and said "What about me?!?!" He was kind
enough to give a review of ADR.

I figured it would be good to also include interviews with "the other
side" of mobile gaming (ie what editors/reviewers go through). So,
without further ado...

>How old are you? What's your professional and educational background?

I've just turned 37 years old. I have a degree in psychology, which is
either the most useless useful degree or the most useful useless
degree, I can't decide which. Professionally, like many freelance
writers, I suppose I'm a drifter. Outside of school, I've been: a
midnight convenience store worker, a mobile phone salesperson, a
private tutor, owner of a video game shop, a social worker, and for
the last several years, the owner and main teacher of a private
language school. I teach English and French. And of course, I've been
a games writer on and off for the last two decades.

>Want to share any history/background with regards to Touch Arcade?

Not much to tell here. My son was getting older so I had more free
time on my hands. Though I had left games writing with a slightly
bitter taste in my mouth after working for one of the big sites and
swore I'd never be back, I had found myself wanting to write about
games again. I was really getting into mobile games at the time and
reading TouchArcade almost daily. I saw a notice Eli Hodapp put up
looking for new writers, applied, and was hired a few weeks
later. That was over three years ago. It's gone well for me, mostly
because I'm afforded the flexibility to write about what I want, even
if it's not necessarily going to bring in raw clicks. TA is cool that
way.

>There will be a lot of indie devs reading this. With regards to
>contacting editors/reviewers to get a game reviewed, what's the
>absolute worst thing for a dev to do/get him on your instant ban
>list?

Um, getting on my ban list is pretty hard. I don't really have one to
speak of. I guess if they were really abusive or something? I'm here
to critique your game, not you as a person.

>There will be a lot of indie devs reading this. With regards to
>contacting editors/reviewers to get a game reviewed, what's the
>absolute best thing for a dev to do/get him in your graces?

Yeah, okay, this is a better question I think. Um, with the caveat
that I can only speak for myself, of course. Well, the first thing to
do is to make a game worth paying attention to. The mobile market is
overflooded to levels that are frankly boggling if you stop and think
about the raw numbers. We at TouchArcade (and presumably our friendly
competition at other sites) have to sift through hundreds of games
each week. As you might expect, when faced with such a task, the
initial cut is swift and not very discriminatory. If your game doesn't
stand out in some way, it probably won't get a second look. For the
love of all that is good, please try not to piggyback your game on
some kind of current event. Try to avoid describing your game as
"current or past popular thing, with a twist!". If there's no other
way to describe your game, it probably isn't right for our audience.

For making contact, every writer is different. Naturally, go through
the official channels each site has set up, but that's easily the
hardest place to get attention due to the sheer volume. Beyond that?
Some writers like a quick note on Twitter. Some like emails. It's very
annoying on top of all the other work you have to do, I know, but you
really do have to get to know each person you're pitching at. I
recommend following them on Twitter well in advance, having normal
human conversations with them where possible, and so on. When your
game is ready to be pitched, you'll be in a good position to ask what
the best means is for doing so. Cold pitching on Twitter rarely works
out. I don't mind it too much, especially if your game is cool, but
some writers get really upset when you do it. So, yeah... I guess just
talk to us like fellow humans and hope for the best?

>Got a funny story about an interaction you've had with regards to an
>editorial you've published (and the game devs involved)?

I don't really have any funny stories, no. Usually interactions that
come from something I've written aren't very positive
experiences. Happy people don't reply most of the time, right? But
people who are upset often do. I will say that in covering mobile, I
get more positive replies from developers after writing an article
than I did on the console beat. But these games are massive passion
projects so I totally get it if you've worked hard for years on
something, see me write a lukewarm review, and want to pop me in the
nose. Please do not carry through on that fantasy, my face is already
a disaster.

>What are your thoughts on premium games vs free wth IAP? Why is it so
>hard for consumers to fork over $3.99 (or any amount of income) for a
>premium game? Have we just become numb to ads and energy bars?

Well... this is a complicated issue. But there's a simple principle
underlying it. People will always want to pay as little as possible to
have their needs satisfied. Most people who play games have very
minimal needs. My uncle who only ever bought the yearly NHL hockey
game and played five or six games before letting it collect dust for
the next nine months? He doesn't need a deep, rich experience. So he
doesn't mind if the game is lacking in depth or only lets him play for
20 minutes at a time. That's probably all he needs. And if that's
free? Well, $3.99 isn't much, but free is less. From there, the game
might get its hooks in him enough for him to spend something, but
probably he'll just delete it and move on to the next thing.

I do believe there is a core contingent of mobile gamers who have
bigger needs and spend appropriately, but if we're being real, the
majority of the traditional core audience has an aversion to mobile
gaming and are certainly getting their needs met elsewhere. The small
percentage who do play heavily on mobile don't add up to a lot when
you split that audience for genre tastes, etc. It doesn't help that
the traditional core market pays little attention to mobile, only
noticing games that are somehow put in front of their face through
advertising or big names being attached. And these days, the companies
that can most afford to do those things are putting their chips on
free-to-play. It's just as hard to win, but the pay-off is bigger, so
for companies like Square Enix or Konami who can afford to pull the
handle on that slot machine several times, it makes more sense.

Of course, I prefer a premium experience, but I also prefer shmups to
first-person shooters. I've made my peace a while ago with the fact
that my tastes are a poor barometer for the market. I've played a lot
of good free-to-play games, too. Yes, even ones with energy bars and
ads. But recently, I'm not interested in the endless experience most
of those games offer. I want an ending so I can move on to the next
thing already.

>I'm starting to release unfinished games and then iterate on them
>publicly. The first couple of months, the game is free, and then I
>start charging for it after it's more playable. Believe it or not,
>it's working! Am I insane? How would this affect editorials and
>reviews?

The mobile games media transplanted the structure and style of the
traditional games media. This has proven to be a poor fit for the
mobile market for many reasons, and updates are a big part of
that. Unfortunately, it's not feasible for us to track every game
after it releases to see if it has gotten better or worse. We're
barely making it financially as-is, and that kind of wide-reaching
gaze would require a lot more staffers. I guess what I'm saying is
that our coverage is still heavily focused on the point of release, so
your new method is probably not going to work well with the existing
review structure. You'll either get a review of your initial
(unfinished) release, or you'll get forgotten by media as the grind
grinds onward. The pricing strategy is interesting though, and I'm
glad it's working out for you.

>How do you think live streaming will affect mobile gaming? Let's play
>YouTube videos?

We're partners with Mobcrush and do regular streams on their
service. I'm yet to be convinced that it's going to catch on the way
it has with other formats. Mobile gaming is heavily built around short
bursts of gameplay, so it's hard to make a long video that is also
entertaining. The games are also cheap or free, so people are less
likely to check out streams to get a sense of a game's quality. And
right there in the name of mobile gaming is 'mobile', which tells me
that people are probably playing on the road or at least wherever they
like in their homes, rather than in front of a decent streaming
set-up.

>What do you think the future of mobile gaming holds for indie game
>devs? Doom and gloom? Bright future?

This is still a relatively young branch of the market, but it's
starting to shake out into what might be its final form. It's a
wishy-washy answer, but I think the market holds both doom and gloom
and bright futures. Like any game platform, you have to aim your
project well and scope it realistically. I've seen a lot of console
cats think they're going to walk into the mobile market and "bring
enlightenment to the unwashed masses" with their console-style ideas,
only to crash and burn when mobile gamers turn to something that fits
their needs better.

I think like any art form, it's rare to be financially successful
simply by making what you want. It's all about playing the odds,
right? If you want to succeed financially on mobile, really go and
take a look at what mobile gamers enjoy playing. Go beyond those top
ten charts. Check mobile gaming communities and so on. Don't just copy
what's popular, think about *why* it's popular. On the other hand, if
you just want to make your cool dream game, well, damn the torpedoes,
full speed ahead. You'll make a few people really happy, but your
chances of even making your yearly Apple developer license fee back
aren't great.

To summarize: Can you succeed? Yes. Will you succeed? Probably
not. But in non-"gold rush" conditions, that's how it is in every
gaming market. If you want safety and security, you might have picked
the wrong job.

>How can game devs better support editors/reviewers (and more
>specifically Touch Arcade)?

We are nothing without the readers and the developers deciding we are
something. You can support us by sharing our articles about your games
and others, telling people about us, and so on. If you've got extra
money in your marketing budget, you can get in touch with our ads
department and buy an ad on the site. But really, the best thing you
can do to keep us relevant is to treat us as relevant. I firmly
believe that it's beneficial to everyone to have an active, free press
covering the platform, especially as more and more mobile sites are
being bought up by big gaming companies. We love to be doing that
work, but just as mobile indie developers aren't seeing much of the
benefits of the massive amounts of people playing Clash of Clans on
their phones, we also have trouble reaching the wider mobile
audience. I feel confident in saying nobody does as much in-depth
coverage of premium/indie mobile games as we do at TouchArcade. If you
think that's something worth protecting, please spread the word.

# Interview With Lonnie Randall - lonniedos

If you don't know who Lonnie is, take a moment to go watch [his YouTube
videos on mobile gaming](https://www.youtube.com/user/lonniedos/featured). They
are pretty freaking entertaining.

## Cold Contacting and Crafting an Email

**First time** I contacted Lonnie was through @ADarkRoomiOS Twitter
account in **June of 2015**. This was a [cold/out of the blue interaction](https://twitter.com/ADarkRoomiOS/status/609734922018750464) which led to a
whole lot of nothing (unsurprisingly). I decided to reach out to
Lonnie because he was a YouTuber that I've watched in the past. I
always loved the hilarity of his videos and figured I'd send him an ADR
tshirt as a means to say hello.

**My next attempt** at cold/out of the blue interaction with Lonnie was
through email in **July of 2015**. I knew that A Dark Room wouldn't be a good fit for his
challenge, but decided to send over promotion codes for my other game
The Ensign. Here was the email I sent over.

>Subject: I'm the creator of the #1 game A Dark Room iOS, and would like to see you rage quit on The Ensign

>Here are a couple of redemption codes for A Dark Room and The Ensign.

>Amir

Let's talk about this email a little bit:

1. It's as short as I could possibly make it without losing context.
2. I send of redemption codes with the email. The _biggest_ mistake
   I've seen developers make, is sending off a cold email _without_
   redemption codes. It's a cold email, so it's very very unlikely
   they'll reply to it. So _just send over the god damn redemption codes with
   the first email you send out_.
3. Few people have time to read an email. So I make sure bold specific
   sentences. It gives the reader the opportunity to skim the email
   for the bold sentences and see if it's worth reading the email as a
   whole.
4. I make it a point to show Lonnie that I _did_ watch his videos by
   stating that A Dark Room is probably not a good game to showcase
   (it's a slow boil game that doesn't fit the content of the videos
   he puts out).

Even with this well crafted email, I didn't get a response. Look, when
you're trying to cold email people who have over 700k+ subscribers on
YouTube, **you're swinging for the fences, manage your expectations accordingly**.

## Another Example of a Cold Email

**The next attempt** of cold/out of the blue interaction with Lonnie
was through another email in **August of 2016 (over 11 months
later)**. Here is the email:

>Hey man,
>
>I emailed you a little over a year ago about The Ensign (the
>pre-sequel to A Dark Room). I got another game out called A Noble
>Circle, [here is a gameplay video of one of the more difficult
>parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw0UflSgIy0). It may be a good
>game to play on your YouTube channel.
>
>Here is a redemption code for A Noble Circle: **NJ9L4NA39P3F**
>
>**I hope you give A Noble Circle a shot and end up enjoying it :-)**
>
>An indie game developer that loves what he does,
>Amir

Let's talk about this email a little bit:

1. Again, it's as short as I could possibly make it without losing context.
2. This time, I included a 30 second gameplay of A Noble Circle which
   I uploaded to YouTube. This gives Lonnie a quick way to get a
   preview of the game without too much investment.
3. I made a point to include that I emailed him a year ago about The
   Ensign. Giving an indication that this wasn't the first email (and
   hoping he remembers me).
4. I included a redemption code with the email.
5. I bolded the parts of the email that I felt were important.

## The Results of Cold Emails and a Bit of Luck

Guess what? No response. Keep in mind that at this point, A Dark Room
has already "went down in history" as being a #1 App. Even with all
the notoriety I have, I still wasn't able to get his attention. What
chance do you have? I'm not trying to be mean, I just want to manage
your expectations.

**After that, I gave up. These interactions spanned ADR making it to the
#1 spot, cold Twitter interactions after @ADarkRoomiOS had 1500
followers, free ADR tshirts, two emails, two _new_ games**.

But I kept watching his content, because I enjoyed it. A few weeks ago
(August 2015), Lonnie posted a video called "Am I Quitting
LonnieDos". That was a huge blow to me personally (especially since
he's one of the few people that creates really really good content
about mobile gaming). My "inner mentor" wanted to reach out to him (I
knew he was young, so I figured I may be able to send over some old
man wisdom). Here was the email:

>Hey man,
>
>It's me again. I saw your vlog titled "Am I Quitting LonnieDos", and
>was wondering if I could interview you for a book I'm writing.
>
>It's about surviving as a content creator in the world of gaming (the
>primary audience is indie mobile game developers).  The book is doing
>very well so far, especially since my audience knows of my success in
>the App Store/creation of a #1 game.
>
>I wanted to give game developers some perspective on what all is
>required with the "let's play" content you create. I know it can be
>incredibly difficult, with a lot of hustling required (**mad respect** to
>you and the hard work you put in). Thought I'd give you a medium to
>talk about it (hence the interview).
>
>**So, in short, can I interview you for my book? It'll give you a soap
>box to rant from and I think indie devs will enjoy seeing your
>perspective.**

I also reached out to him from my personal Twitter account, letting
him know that I sent him an email. **This wasn't a marketing attempt,
this was me simply identifying a struggle I've felt myself with
content creation, and a genuine attempt at giving someone else some hope.**

**To my astonishment, he replied to the email.**

>Hey Amir,
>
>Yeah, that sounds really cool! I'd be glad to do an interview. Thanks for the interest! (and the kind words!)
>
>Just let me know however you wanna do it and l'll be there.
>
>Thanks again.


This was the follow up email I sent.

>I'll just send the question over to you tomorrow. [Here's a free
>download of the book btw, feel free to share it with whomever you
>like](https://leanpub.com/survivingtheappstore/c/Iu7nkKKIgrsk).
>
>Also, sorry about the random emails throughout the year(s). I know
>you probably get a bunch of devs trying to email you about their
>games. Just wanted to let you know that I appreciate the response
>(and as I said before, appreciate the effort/hustle you have).
>
>**I'm assuming I'm a little older than you (I'm 32). Out of all the
>things I've seen in people, the grit/discipline that's required to do
>what you do will take you far in life (even if it's away from content
>creation on YouTube). So remember that.** Take care dude. Don't sweat
>the haters and the existential crisis of being an "insignificant"
>human (we all go through it from time to time). **Expect an email
>tomorrow with interview questions.**

## A Message to the Sleazeball Marketers that Might be Reading This in Search for a "Growth Hack"

These emails I sent to Lonnie (in fact every email I send to every
person) are backed with genuine intent and consideration. Something
you can't fake. So don't take this as a means to interact with Lonnie
(or any anyone else I've interviewed for that matter). Find _you're_
genuine voice, it'll be different than mine. It's most definitely
_not_ the bullshit templated emails you spam everyone with.

**Alright alright, I'm off my rant. Here's the interview with some more commentary:**

>How old are you? What's your professional and educational background?
>note: The more information you can give the better (everything from
>growing up to now). This is a means for the audience to realize that
>you're a human being and build some empathy before the questions
>come.

I'm 21 years old, 22 next month. I graduated high school in 2012 and
went to a community college in Florida for a little over a year before
dropping out. It was around that time that my YouTube channel kinda
started to "take off" or whatever, so YouTube is the only "job" I've
had up to this point. Which is weird.

_My Two Cents_

I usually don't recommend dropping out of college, so if you're around
Lonnie's age, don't take what he said as gospel. But if Lonnie were to
come up to me and say "hey, I'm thinking of dropping out." I'd say
"yes, do it." Why? Because he's demonstrated that he's got the
discipline to "do stuff" with out the need for structure. He's self
motivated, and has an incredibly long content creation history that proves that.

>Holy shit, 700k+ subscribers on YouTube, 8 years of content, 300+
>videos on your vlog and 1500+ videos on your mobile gaming
>channel. That's crazy. Can you speak to how much work goes into a
>single 5 minute video? From preproduction/concept, through filming,
>editing, and uploading to YouTube? note: I don't think anyone
>realizes the immense amount of work that goes into this.

I guess the whole video process varies depending on the type of
video. For the gaming videos that most people probably know me for, it
takes around an hour of filming and then maybe 2-4 hours of editing
and getting it up online. Not much pre-planning since the commentary
is all improv. The workload for a single video isn't too crazy, but
when I was uploading 2-3 gameplay videos a day, it definitely ate up a
lot of my time.

_My Two Cents_

Take a moment to internalize the sheer amount of time his invested in
building up to 700k subscribers. This was an _eight year_ process. It
took him a good _five years_ just to find his voice with mobile gaming
and hit critical mass. Overnight successes are few and far
in between.

>How'd you consistently do this for so long? Especially with the low
>view counts at the beginning? What was your drive and end goal? It's
>obvious that you put in a lot of hard work to get where you are. How
>much did luck play in your success?

I've always loved making videos, so it wasn't hard to keep doing
it. I've been doing YouTube for over 8 years now and the first 5 were
just for fun. My goal wasn't ever to make it a job or anything; just
did it for fun. It just so happened to work out as soon as I needed it
to weirdly (when I left school). I believe that luck is a huge factor
for success on YouTube. I guess I just stumbled into the right niche
at the right time and just kinda went with it.

>Throughout this ridiculously long journey of content creation, what
>was one of the happiest moments (the more info, the better of
>course)?

Hitting 100,000 subscribers was pretty cool. I feel like that was when
other content creators started noticing my existence, which was a new
and cool feeling. My parents got me a cake for hitting that milestone
as well. Which was super silly, but also meant a lot because it sort
of felt like in their eyes, I was doing something legitimate. (If that
makes sense.) They obviously didn't grow up with YouTube and the
internet and whatnot, so I know they had trouble fully understanding
what I was trying to do. But at that point, even if they couldn't
fully wrap their head around it, it felt like they were proud of me.

_My Two Cents_

Dear Lonnie's parents. You should be very very very proud of your son. I
mean he's been interviewed for a freaking book!

>What was one of the saddest moments (the more info, the better of course)?

There are a lot of discouraging moments, but the only real "sad"
experience I've had being on YouTube would have to be when my last
relationship ended. It was difficult enough by itself, but having to
almost constantly be in a good mood (or pretend to be in a good mood)
in order to upload videos regularly was rough. Plus our relationship
was very public, so it was hard to want to explain something so
personal to my audience online as I was going through it. I still get
comments about it daily.

_My Two Cents_

Thank you Lonnie for this candid response. We now live in a very
public world (with Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram, Snapchat,
Periscope, Pintrest, et al). I have no idea how you keep the two
separate.

>How did you get into recording yourself playing mobile games? Any
>interesting story behind that (it seems like it took you about 2
>years to even discover that you wanted to do gaming videos, and
>another year to find that you wanted to do mobile gaming videos)?

I got into making mobile gaming videos pretty randomly. I tried out
console gaming first, but quickly realized that the videos were more
entertaining when I was reacting to a game I had never seen before for
the first time. So I started doing some iPhone gameplay videos on apps
that I had never played before. Then I saw that those videos were
getting more views than basically anything else that I had ever
uploaded, so I went with it.

_My Two Cents_

I hope this doesn't come as a surprise, but success takes time. You'll
have a lot of false starts. So keep experimenting.

>I'm pretty sure your inbox gets flooded with devs asking you to play
>their games on their channel (present company included). What's the
>absolute worse thing a developer can do with regards to pitching to
>you? note: Again, it's okay to be brutally honest about this kind of
>stuff.

I guess the WORST thing to see in an email is, like, when a PR person
forgets to even put your name in the template that they're copying and
pasting to a bunch of people at once. I get a bunch of emails that say
something like "Hello, [YOUR NAME HERE] We love your channel!" It's
pretty funny at the same time, though.

_My Two Cents_

You already know how I feel about sleazeball marketers.

>What's the absolute best thing a developer can do with regards to
>pitching to you about playing their game on your channel?

Just make a cool game, really. If the game is cool, I'll play
it. If it's not, I won't. I don't need much convincing. I guess
screenshots and/or videos can help me determine that faster.

>How do you feel about premium games vs games that are free + IAP/Ads?
>Why are people so hesitant to fork over a small amount of money up
>front?

I think both models can be done right and both can be done wrong. Since
I'm a YouTuber, I don't mind paying money for the games that I play. I
guess some people just don't value mobile games that much, which is
sad.

>What are your thoughts on the quality of mobile games vs other
>platforms (personally, I feel that most mobile games are trashy,
>ad/IAP ridden cash grabs)? Is mobile gaming doomed? Or am I blowing
>things out of proportion.

I think that, while there is a lot of junk on mobile, there is equal
amounts if not more junk on PC/consoles. I think there are a lot of
amazing games on mobile. I play mobile games way more often than
anything else. It is "doomed?" I doubt it. But I could definitely be
wrong.

_My Two Cents_

From Wikipedia:

Sturgeon's revelation, commonly referred to as
[Sturgeon's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law), is
an adage commonly cited as "ninety percent of everything is crap". It
is derived from quotations by Theodore Sturgeon, an American science
fiction author and critic; while Sturgeon coined another adage that he
termed "Sturgeon's law", it is his "revelation" that is usually
referred to by that term.

I think that's a really cool approach! I don't think I've heard of
anyone else doing that before! As for how it would affect
content creation, I guess you could be running the risk of some idiot
like me only playing the game in it's early stage, showing that off,
and then never going back and showing the improved version. Which
wouldn't be the best case scenario for you, or any developer who
wanted to test games publicly. From my perspective, that could very
very easily happen. I play a ton of games all the time on my channel
and most of the time, I don't revisit them. There just isn't enough
time.

>I grew up playing games in front of a TV, staying up all night with
>the volume turned way down so my parents couldn't hear... getting
>lost in the stories they told and all the awesome adventures that lay
>ahead. Do you think mobile games will ever capture that kind of
>feeling? Or is it simply the wrong medium for those kind of games?

I think stories in games on mobile are valued less because, since
there are SO many games, people's attention span has been
shortened. When I let a friend use my iPad, I've noticed they click
into a game, play for a minute, click out and jump into another. A lot
of people seem like they go to mobile gaming for immediate stimulation
for short bursts of time. That said, I do think there will always be a
minority of people who will gladly dig deeper into the story-driven
titles.

_My Two Cents_

See my chapter on Make Games for Mobile. I go into a lot of these very
valid observations that Lonnie has made.

>There will be other content creators reading this book (specifically
>marketers/ad men). Any tips you have with regards to marketing and
>growing a user base (I've covered the "don't be a sleazeball, spammy,
>lazy marketing person" in a chapter)?

I would recommend not only hitting up the bigger YouTubers/streamers
to check out your game, but also don't underestimate the content
creators with smaller audiences. I've seen a few games grow followings
on sites like Mobcrush that I'd personally never heard of, but I saw a
bunch of my friends streaming it all the time, so I tried it
myself. You never know which of the big guys are watching the little
guys.

_My Two Cents_

Something I should have done. I spent a year contacting Lonnie. _And
only with sheer dumb luck and perfect timing was I able to get this
interview/attention_. Contacting smaller content creators will yield
much much better results. So start there and get those early wins.

# I'd Give Anything

With all the:

- quitting my high paying corporate job
- taking a sabbatical
- ups and downs of game development
- going back to work after ADR fizzled
- taking some more time out to write this book

I've found one of the most precious resources we overlook: time.

Figure out what's meaningful to you, and put all your effort into making time to pursue it. Here is the short story, hope you enjoy.

She walks onto the small wooden stage, violin in hand. Not a walk of confidence, but of humility. Her steps echo through the auditorium, crisp and hollow.

"Another poorly constructed hall," she says to herself, as she thinks back to her high school orchestra playing at the Meyerson.

She still remembers her teacher give his "wait for it" smirk. She remembers him telling everyone to play the first note of measure 30. She still remembers the pure joy she felt as the sound from every instrument filled the air, merging with one another as they bounced off the walls, and making its way back to the stage seconds later, carrying a life changing message: "This is what you created."

This room was definitely not like that.

People start filing in as she tunes her violin. They all wear excited smiles, but not for her. They smile because of the "on the clock" break they were getting, and for the nice cheese spread the company laid out.

Holiday gigs paid well, and the requirements were always the same:

>We're holding a company event to show appreciation for our employees. We need an amazing violinist to play some live holiday music during the celebration. A recorded piano accompaniment will be provided. Business casual attire will be required for this event.

Playing an hour for half a grand was a great paycheck. She went through the provided play list which contained upbeat songs like Jingle Bell Rocks and some solemn tunes like Silent Night.

"Just have to do this last corporate function, then I can skirt by for the next few months without working."

With her fingers and bowing on auto pilot, she counts all the ill fitting dress shirts the men wear. The backs of their muffin tops wrinkled and creased from sitting in a chair all day. She imagines an alien visiting Earth for the first time, standing beside her.

"So let me make sure I understand this. When a male of your species enters this building, he is required to stuff his upper garment into his pants, and tie a piece of cloth around his neck? And females have to do what?!"

The companies never noticed that she wore the same light gray cardigan, gray dress, light gray belt, and gray heels to every event. It was the only business casual attire she owned. Hair was easy, just tie it up in a nice tight bun. It looked elegant. She'd have her roommate apply her makeup. She'd skip polishing her nails though. They were always filed well past her callused fingertips.

Only a few more minutes to go. This is when she'd always play one of the pieces she composed. Her focus changes. Her eyes piercingly look down the neck and finger board. She listens to her own heartbeat - her living metronome - trying desperately to feel each phase of the heart's cardiac cycle. Rosin dust lifts violently off the strings as she begins to play, she breaths it in.

Five minutes for five months of work. Her ten thousand dollar violin sings a bittersweet song of joy and resentment. She executes flawlessly. Silence fills the air, signaling the employees to turn and clap before going back to eating cheese and drinking wine.

She gives the invoice to human resources, and receives her check shortly after. She drives home and opens the door to the one bedroom apartment, greeted warmly by her roommate. She heads to the small dining nook - her humble corner of the apartment - and sits on her sofa bed. She smiles thinking about the next few months she'll have to devote to writing her next piece.

Her roommate, as always, turns to her and says, "I'd give anything to play like you."

Which always yields the same, smiling response.

"No, you wouldn't. :-)"
